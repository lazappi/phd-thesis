## Analysing scRNA-seq data {#intro-analysis}

Cell capture technologies and scRNA-seq protocols have developed rapidly but
the data they produce still presents a number of challenges. Existing
approaches are inefficient, capturing around 10 percent of transcripts in a
cell [@Grun2014-zn]. When combined with the low sequencing depth per cell this
results in a limited sensitivity and an inability to detect lowly expressed
transcripts. The small amount of starting material also contributes to high
levels of technical noise, complicating downstream analysis and making it
difficult to detect biological differences [@Liu2016-wq]. In order to capture
cells they must first be dissociated into single-cell suspensions but this step
can be non-trivial. Some tissues or cell types may be more difficult to
separate than others and the treatments required to break them apart may affect
the health of the cells and their transcriptional profiles. It has been
suggested that damage caused by dissociated can be minimised by using a
cold-active protease to separate cells [@Adam2017-zl]. Other cell types may be
too big or have other characteristics that prevent them being captured.
Multiple cells may be captured together or empty wells or droplets sequenced
making quality control of datasets an important consideration.

As well as increasing technical noise the small amounts of starting material
and low sequencing depth mean there are many occasions where zero counts are
recorded, indicating no measured expression for a particular gene in a
particular cell. These zero counts often represent the true biological state we
are interested in as we that different genes will be expressed by different
cell types. However, zeros can also be the result of confounding biological
factors such as stage in the cell cycle, transcriptional bursting and
environmental interactions which cause genuine changes in expression but that
might not be of interest to a particular study. On top of this there are
effects that are purely technical factors. In particular sampling effects which
can result in "dropout" events where a transcript is truly expressed in a
sample but is not observed in the sequencing data [@Hicks2017-ut]. In bulk
experiments these effects are limited by averaging across the cells in a sample
and the greater sequencing depth but for single-cell experiments they can
present a significant challenge for analysis as methods must account for the
missing information and the large number of zeros may cause the assumptions of
existing methods to be violated.

One approach to tackling the problem of too many zeros is to use zero-inflated
versions of common distributions [@Pierson2015-qp; @Risso2018-dg;
@Van_den_Berge2018-ip; @Miao2018-ft]. However, it is still debatable whether
scRNA-seq datasets are truly zero-inflated or the additional zeros are better
modeled with standard distributions with lower means. Another approach to
analysis is to impute some of the zeros, replacing them with estimates of how
expressed those genes truly are based on their expression in similar cells
using methods such as MAGIC [@Van_Dijk2018-dk], SAVER [@Huang2018-ef;
@Wang2018-av] or scImpute [@Li2018-gx]. However imputation comes with the risk
of introducing false structure that is not actually present in the samples
[@Andrews2018-li].

Bulk RNA-seq experiments usually involve predefined groups of samples, for
example cancer cells and normal tissue, different tissue types or treatment and
control groups. It is possible to design scRNA-seq experiments in the same way
by sorting cells into known groups based on surface markers, sampling them at a
series of time points or comparing treatment groups, but often single-cell
experiments are more exploratory. Many of the single-cell studies to date have
sampled developing or mature tissues and attempted to profile the cell types
that are present [@Zeisel2015-rd; @Patel2014-bl; @Treutlein2014-wd;
@Usoskin2015-fz; @Buettner2015-rq; @Klein2015-iw; @Trapnell2014-he]. This
approach is best exemplified by the Human Cell Atlas project which is
attempting to produce a reference of the transcriptional profiles of all the
cell types in the human body [@Regev2017-wg]. Similar projects exist for other
species and specific tissues [@Cao2017-ig; @The_Tabula_Muris_Consortium2017-rm;
@Wu2018-xd; @Han2018-kp; @Saunders2018-ut; @Plass2018-sa; @Bhaduri2018-nt;
@Yuan2018-qu].

As scRNA-seq datasets have become more widely available a standard analysis
workflow has developed which can be applied to many experiments [@Lun2016-lp;
@Perraudeau2017-ii]. This workflow can be divided into four phases shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:phases): 1) Data acquisition, pre-processing of samples to
produce a cell by gene expression matrix, 2) Data cleaning, quality control to
refine the dataset used for analysis, 3) Cell assignment, grouping or ordering
of cells based on their transcriptional profile, and 4) Gene identification to
find genes that represent particular groups and can be used to interpret them.
Within each phase a range of processes may be used and there are now many tools
available for completing each of them, with over `r 10 * floor(n_tools / 10)`
tools currently available. An introduction to the phases of scRNA-seq analysis
is provided here but the analysis tools landscape is more fully explored in
Chapter \@ref(tools).

```{r phases, fig.cap = "(ref:cap-phases)", fig.scap = "(ref:scap-phases)", out.width = "100%"}

(ref:cap-phases) Phases of a standard scRNA-seq analysis workflow. In Phase 1 (Data acquisition) samples are pre-processed to produce an expression matrix that undergoes quality control and filtering in Phase 2 (Data cleaning). Phase 3 (Cell assignment) groups or orders cell according to their transcriptional profile and in Phase 4 (Gene identification) genes describing those groups are discovered and used to interpret them.

### Pre-processing and quality control

The result of a sequencing experiment is typically a set of image files from
the sequencer or a FASTQ file containing nucleotide reads but for most analyses
we use an expression matrix where each column is a cell, each row is a feature
and the values indicate expression levels. To produce this matrix there is a
series of pre-processing steps, typically beginning will some quality control
of the raw reads. Reads are then aligned to a reference genome and the number
of reads overlapping annotated features (genes or transcripts) is counted.
Probabilistic quantification methods can be applied to full-length scRNA-seq
datasets but have required adaptations such as the Alevin method for UMI-based
datasets [@Srivastava2018-fy] in the Salmon package. When using conventional
alignment UMI samples need extra processing with tools like UMI-tools
[@Smith2017-nz], umis [@Svensson2017-zo] or zUMIs [@Parekh2018-ug] in order to
assign cell barcodes and deduplicate UMIs. For datasets produced using the 10x
Chromium platform the company provides the Cell Ranger software which is a
complete pre-processing pipeline that also includes an automated downstream
analysis. Other packages such as scPipe [@Tian2018-ub] also aim to streamline
this process with some such as Falco [@Yang2017-yz] designed to work on
scalable cloud based infrastructure which may be required as bigger datasets
continue to be produced.

Quality control of individual cells is important as experiments will contain
low-quality cells that can be uninformative or lead to misleading results.
Particular types of cells that are commonly removed include damaged cells,
doublets where multiple cells have been captured together [@DePasquale2018-ct;
@McGinnis2018-ec] and empty droplets or wells that have been sequenced but do
not contain a cell [@Lun2018-lb]. Quality control can be performed on various
levels including the quality scores of the reads themselves and how or where
they align to features of the expression matrix. The Cellity package attempts
to automate this process by inspecting a series of biological and technical
features and using machine learning methods to distinguish between high and
low-quality cells [@Ilicic2016-wy]. However the authors found that many of the
features were cell type specific and more work needs to be done to make this
approach more generally applicable. The scater package [@McCarthy2017-ql]
emphasises a more exploratory approach to quality control at the expression
matrix level but providing a series of functions for visualising various
features of a dataset. These plots can then be used for selecting thresholds
for removing cells. Plate-based capture platforms can produce additional biases
based on the location of individual wells, a problem which is addressed by the
OEFinder package which attempts to identify and visualise these "ordering
effects"[@Leng2016-it].

Filtering and selection of features also deserves attention. Genes or
transcripts that are lowly expressed are typically removed from datasets in
order to reduce computational time and the effect of multiple-testing
correction but it is unclear how many counts indicate that a gene is truly
"expressed". Many downstream analyses operate on a selected subset of genes and
how they are selected can have a dramatic effect on their results
[@Chen2018-ug]. These features are often selected based on how variable they
are across the dataset but this may be a result of noise rather than biological
importance. Alternative selection methods have been proposed such as M3Drop
which identifies genes that have more zeros than would be expected based on
their mean expression [@Andrews2018-pq].

### Normalisation and integration

Effective normalisation is just as crucial for single-cell experiments as it is
for bulk RNA-seq datasets. FPKM or TPM transformations can be used, but for UMI
data the gene length correction is not required as reads only come from the
ends of transcripts [@Phipson2017-qt]. Normalisation methods designed for
detecting differential expression between bulk samples such as TMM or the DESeq
method can be applied, but it is unclear how suitable they in the single-cell
context. Many of the early normalisation methods developed specifically for
scRNA-seq data made use of spike-ins. These are synthetic RNA sequences added
to cells in known quantities such as the External RNA Controls Consortium
(ERCC) control mixes, a set of 92 transcripts from 250 to 2000 basepairs long
based on bacterial plasmids. Brennecke et al. [@Brennecke2013-pt], Ding et al.
[@Ding2015-ht] and Grün, Kester and van Oudenaarden [@Grun2014-zn] all propose
methods for estimating technical variance using spike-ins, as does Bayesian
Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data (BASiCS) [@Vallejos2015-ef]. Using
spike-ins for normalisation assumes that they properly capture the dynamics of
the underlying dataset and even if this is the case it is restricted to
protocols where they can be added which does not include droplet-based capture
techniques. The scran package implements a method that doesn't rely on
spike-ins, instead using a pooling approach to compensate for the large number
of zero counts where expression levels are summed across similar cells before
calculating size factors that are deconvolved back to the original cells
[@Lun2016-mq]. The BASiCS method has also been adapted to experiments without
spike-ins by integrating data replicated across batches [@Eling2018-lp], but
only for designed experiments where groups are known in advance.

Early scRNA-seq studies often made use of only a single sample but as
technologies have become cheaper and more widely available it is common to see
studies with multiple batches or making use of publicly available data produced
by other groups. While this expands the potential insights to be gained it
presents a problem as to how to integrate these datasets and a range of
computational approaches for performing integration have been developed
including bbknn [@Park2018-ri], ClusterMap [@Gao2018-ij], kBET
[@Buttner2017-rg], LIGER [@Welch2018-gb], matchSCore [@Mereu2018-bx], Scanorama
[@Hie2018-cf] and scMerge [@Lin2018-ln]. The alignment approach in the Seurat
package [@Butler2018-js] uses Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
[@Hotelling1936-ni, @Hardoon2004-ev] to identify a multi-dimensional subspace
that is consistent between datasets. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
[@Berndt1994-lh] is then used to stretch and align these dimensions so that the
datasets are similarly spread along them. Some tasks can be performed using
these aligned dimensions but as the original expression matrix is unchanged the
integration is not used for other tasks such as differential expression
testing. The authors of scran use a Mutual Nearest Neighbours (MNN) approach
that calculates a cosine distance between cells in different datasets then
identifies those that share a neighbourhood [@Haghverdi2018-bd]. Batch
correction vectors can then be calculated and subtracted from one dataset to
overlay them. A recent update to the Seurat method combines these approaches by
applying CCA before using the MNN approach to identify "anchor" cells that have
common features in the different datasets [@Stuart2018-ra].

### Grouping cells

Grouping similar cells is a key step in analysing scRNA-seq datasets that is
not usually required for bulk experiments and as such it has been a key focus
of methods development with over XXX tools released for clustering cells. Some
of these methods include SINgle CEll RNA-seq profiling Analysis (SINCERA)
[@Guo2015-mf], Single-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3) [@Kiselev2017-an],
single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) [@Buettner2015-rq] and Spanning-tree
Progression Analysis of Density-normalised Events (SPADE) [@Anchang2016-vo], as
well as BackSPIN which was used to identify nine cell types and 47 distinct
subclasses in the mouse cortex and hippocampus in one of the earliest studies
to demonstrate the possibilities of scRNA-seq [@Zeisel2015-rd]. All of these
tools attempt to cluster similar cells together based on their expression
profiles, forming groups of cells of the same type. The clustering method in
the Seurat package [@Satija2015-or] has become particularly popular and has
been shown to perform well, particularly on UMI datasets [@Duo2018-qb;
Freytag2018-ic]. This method begins by selecting a set of highly variable genes
then performing PCA on them. A set of dimensions is then selected that contains
most of the variation in the dataset. Alternatively if Seurat's alignment
method has been used to integrate datasets the aligned CCA dimensions are used
instead. Next a Shared Nearest Neighbours (SNN) graph is constructed by
considering the distance between cells in this multidimensional space and the
overlap between shared neighbourhoods. Seurat uses a euclidean distance but is
has been suggested that correlations can provide better results [@Kim2018-xn].
In order to separate cells into clusters a community detection algorithm such
as Louvain optimisation [@Blondel2008-ym] is run on the graph with a resolution
parameter that controls the number of clusters that are produced. Selecting
this parameter and similar parameters in other methods is difficult but
important as the number of clusters selected can affect the interpretation of
results. I address this problem with a visualisation-based approach in Chapter
\@ref(clust-trees).

For tissue types that are well understood or where comprehensive references are
available an alternative to unsupervised clustering is to directly classify
cells. This can be done using a gating approach based on the expression of
known marker genes similar to that commonly used for flow cytometry
experiments. Alternatively, machine learning algorithms can be used to perform
classification based on the overall expression profile. Methods such as scmap
[@Kiselev2018-nu], scPred [@Alquicira-Hernandez2018-xu], CaSTLe
[@Lieberman2018-zg] and Moana [@Wagner2018-xl] take this approach.
Classification has the advantage of making use of existing knowledge and avoids
manual annotation and interpretation of clusters which can often be difficult
and time consuming. However it is biased by what is present in the reference
datasets used and typically cannot reveal previously unknown cell types or
states. As projects like the Human Cell Atlas produce well-annotated references
based on scRNA-seq data the viability of classification and other
reference-based methods will improve.

### Ordering cells

In some studies, for example in development where stem cells are
differentiating into mature cell types, it may make sense to order cells along
a continuous trajectory from one cell type to another instead of assigning them
to distinct groups. Trajectory analysis was pioneered by the Monocle package
which used dimensionality reduction and computation of a minimum spanning tree
to explore a model of skeletal muscle differentiation [@Trapnell2014-he]. Since
then the Monocle algorithm has been updated [@Qiu2017-mq] and a range of others
developed including TSCAN [@Ji2016-ws], SLICER [@Welch2016-cw], CellTree
[@DuVerle2016-ni], Sincell [@Julia2015-fz], Mpath [@Chen2016-kx] and Slingshot
[@Street2018-sc]. In their review of trajectory inference methods Cannoodt,
Saelens and Saeys break the process into two steps (Figure
\@ref(fig:trajectory-inference)) [@Cannoodt2016-iv]. In the first step
dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE [@Maaten2008-ne] or UMAP
[@McInnes2018-ul] are used to project cells into lower dimensions where the
cells are clustered or a graph constructed between them. The trajectory is then
created by finding a path through the cells and ordering the cells along it.
The same group of authors have conducted a comprehensive comparison of ordering
methods evaluating their performance on a range of real and synthetic datasets
[@Saelens2018-sf]. To do so the authors had to develop metrics for comparing
trajectories from different methods and built a comprehensive infrastructure
for running and evaluating software tools. They found that Slingshot, Monocle
and TSCAN performed well in many situations but that other methods could be
effective in specific cases.

In the first stage dimensionality reduction is used to convert the data to a simpler representation. In the second stage a trajectory is identified and the cells ordered. Image from Cannoodt, Saelens and Saeys _"Computational methods for trajectory inference from single-cell transcriptomics"_ [@Cannoodt2016-iv].

An alternative continuous approach is the cell velocity technique
[@Svensson2018-lu] introduced for scRNA-seq data in the velocyto package
[@La_Manno2018-tv]. RNA-seq studies typically focus on the expression of mature
mRNA molecules but a sample will also contain immature mRNA that are yet to be
spliced. Examining the reads assigned to introns can indicate newly transcribed
mRNA molecules and therefore which genes are currently active. Instead of
assigning cells to discrete groups or along a continuous path velocyto uses
reads from unspliced regions to place them in a space and create a vector
indicating the direction in which the transcriptional profile is heading. This
vector can show that a cell is differentiating in a particular way or that a
specific transcriptional program has been activated.

Deciding on which cell assignment approach to use depends on the source of the
data, the goals of the study and the questions that are being asked. Both
grouping and ordering can be informative and it is often useful to attempt both
on a dataset and see how they compare.

### Gene detection and interpretation

Once cells are assigned by clustering or ordering the problem is to interpret
what these groups represent. For clustered datasets this is usually done by
identifying genes that are differentially expressed across the groups or marker
genes that are expressed in a single cluster. Many methods have been suggested
for testing differential expression some of which take in to account the unique
features of scRNA-seq data, for example D3E [@Delmans2016-bp], DESingle
[@Miao2018-ft], MAST [@Finak2015-ow], scDD [@Korthauer2016-yq] and SCDE
[@Kharchenko2014-tb]. The large number of cells in scRNA-seq datasets mean that
some of the problems that made standard statistical tests unsuitable for bulk
RNA-seq experiments do not apply and simple methods like the unpaired Wilcoxon
rank-sum test (or Mann-Whitney U test), Student's t-test or logistic regression
may give reasonable results in this setting. Methods originally developed for
bulk experiments have also been applied to scRNA-seq datasets but the
assumptions they make may not be appropriate for single-cell data. Methods such
as ZINB-WaVe [@Van_den_Berge2018-ip] may be required to transform the data so
that bulk testing methods are appropriate. A comprehensive evaluation of 36
differential expression testing approaches found that methods developed for
bulk RNA-seq did not perform worse than scRNA-seq specific methods, however
bulk methods depend on how lowly-expressed genes were filtered
[@Soneson2018-fb]. The authors also observed that some methods were biased in
the types of features they tended to detect as differentially expressed. Often
the goal is not to find all the genes that are differentially expressed between
groups but to identify genes which uniquely mark particular clusters. This goal
is open to alternative approaches such as the Gini coefficient which measures
unequal distribution across a population. Another approach is to construct
machine learning classifiers for each gene to distinguish between one group and
all other cells. Genes that give good classification performance should be good
indicators of what is specific to that cluster. It is also possible to identify
genes that might have the same mean between groups but differ in variance or
other characteristics of their expression distribution.

When cells have been ordered along a continuous trajectory the task is slightly
different. Instead of testing for a difference in means between two groups the
goal is to find genes that have a relationship between expression and
pseudotime. This can be accomplished by fitting splines to the relationship
between pseudotime and expression and testing the fitting coefficients. For
more complex trajectories it can also be useful to find genes that are
differently expressed along each side of a branch points. Monocle's BEAM
(Branch Expression Analysis Modelling) method does this using a likelihood
ratio test between splines where the branch assignments are known or unknown
[@Qiu2017-bi]. Genes that are associated with a trajectory are important in
their own right as they describe the biology along a path but they can also be
used to identify cell types at end points.

Interpreting the meaning of detected markers genes is a difficult task and is
likely to remain so. Some methods have been developed for this task such as
celaref which suggests cluster labels based on similarity of marker genes to an
already characterised reference dataset. Gene set testing to identify related
categories such as Gene Ontology terms can also help but often it is necessary
to rely on the results of previous functional studies. Ultimately this can only
be reliably done by working closely with experts who have significant domain
knowledge in the cell types being studied. An additional concern for
unsupervised scRNA-seq studies is that the same genes are used for clustering
or ordering and determining what those clusters or trajectories mean. This is a
problem addressed by Zhang, Karnath and Tse who suggest a differential
expression test using a long-tailed distribution for testing genes following
clustering [@Zhang2018-sr].

### Alternative analyses

Some uses of scRNA-seq data fall outside the most common workflow and methods
have been developed for a range of other purposes. For example methods have
been designed for assigning haplotypes to cells [@Edsgard2016-bn], detecting
allele-specific expression [@Reinius2016-hu; @Jiang2017-sb; @Choi2018-kz],
identifying alternative splicing [@Welch2016-dv; @Huang2017-lp; @Song2017-ym]
or calling single nucleotide or complex genomic variants [@Poirion2018-mc;
@Ding2018-ah; @Petti2018-bj]. Other methods have been designed for specific
cell types or tissues such as reconstructing immune cell receptors on B-cells
(BraCeR [@Lindeman2018-bk], BRAPeS [@Afik2018-ht], VDJPuzzle
[@Rizzetto2018-ev]) or T-cells (TraCeR [@Stubbington2016-xw], TRAPeS
[@Afik2017-qw]) or interrogating the development of cancer samples (HoneyBADGER
[@Fan2018-ki], SSrGE [@Poirion2018-mc]). Most future studies can be expected to
continue to follow common practice but it also expected that researchers will
continue to push the boundaries of what it is possible to study using scRNA-seq
technologies.

### Evaluation of scRNA-seq analysis methods

Although the analysis for many scRNA-seq studies follow a standard workflow
there is wide more variation in the tools that are used. We are now at the
stage where there are multiple software packages for completing every stage of
analysis. Deciding which tools to use can be difficult and depends on a number
of factors including effectiveness, robustness, scalability, availability, ease
of use and quality of documentation. In terms of effectiveness publications
describing analysis methods should demonstrate two things: 1) they can perform
the task they are designed for (at least as well as existing methods) and 2)
performing that task leads to biological insights. Answering the first question
is difficult using real datasets as often the underlying truth is not known.
For this reason simulation techniques are commonly used to produce synthetic
datasets in order to evaluate methods. I present a software package for
simulating scRNA-seq data in Chapter \@ref(simulation). Simulation is an
efficient and flexible approach for producing gold standard datasets but
synthetic data can never fully reproduce a real dataset. An alternative
approach is to carefully construct a gold standard biological dataset by
combining samples where the true differences are known [@Tian2018-ok]. These
datasets can be extremely useful but are difficult, time-consuming and
expensive to produce and can only reproduce a limited set of scenarios.
Comprehensive evaluations of methods have already been conducted for some
aspects of scRNA-seq analysis including clustering [@Duo2018-qb;
@Freytag2018-ic], trajectory inference [@Saelens2018-sf] and differential
expression testing [@Soneson2018-fb] but these will need to continue to be
performed and updated as the field matures and new methods are developed.
