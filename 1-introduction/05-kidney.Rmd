## Kidney development {#intro-kidney}

One area that has particularly benefitted from the possibilities created by
scRNA-seq technology is developmental biology. Although the genes involved in
the development of many organs are now well understood, arriving at this
knowledge has required many painstaking experiments to investigate a single
gene at a time. During development cells are participating in a continuous
dynamic process involving the maturation from one cell type to another and the
creation of new cell types. Single-cell RNA-seq captures a snapshot of the
expression of all the genes involved in this process, allowing the
transcriptome of intermediate and mature cells to be studied. This has revealed
that some of the genes thought to be markers of specific cell types are more
widely expressed or involved in other processes.

### Structure and function

The kidney is the organ responsible for filtering the blood in order to remove
waste products. In humans, kidneys grow as a pair of functional organs with
each being around the size of an adult fist and weighing about 150 grams. Blood
flows into the kidney via the renal artery and the blood vessels form a
tree-like branching structure with ever smaller capillaries (Figure
\@ref(fig:kidney)A). At the end of these branches are nephrons, the functional
filtration unit of the kidney (Figure \@ref(fig:kidney)B). Humans can have
around 1 million nephrons [@Bertram2011-kk] that are formed during development
and just after birth, however they cannot be regenerated during adulthood. A
capillary loop is formed inside a structure at the end of the nephron called a
glomerulus and surrounded by Bowman's capsule. Here specialised cells called
podocytes create a structure called the slit diaphragm that allows water, metal
ions and small molecules to be filtered while keeping blood cells and larger
species such as proteins trapped within the bloodstream. The rest of the
nephron is divided into segments that are responsible for different processes
involved in balancing the concentration of these species in the filtrate
(Figure \@ref(fig:kidney)C). The tubular segments of the nephron are surrounded
by capillaries, allowing molecules to be transferred between the filtrate and
blood as required. The first segment of the nephron is the proximal tubule.
Here common biomolecules such as glucose, amino acids and bicarbonate are
reabsorbed into the bloodstream, as is most of the water present. Other
molecules including urea and ammonium ions are secreted from the blood into the
filtrate at his stage. The proximal tubule is followed by the loop of Henle and
the distal tubule where ions are reabsorbed including potassium, chlorine,
magnesium and calcium. The final segment is the collecting duct where salt
concentrations are balanced by exchanging sodium in the filtrate for potassium
in the bloodstream using a process controlled by the hormone aldosterone. The
remaining filtrate is then passed to the ureter where it is carried to the
bladder and collected as urine while the blood leaves via the renal vein. In
order to perform this complex series of reabsorption and secretion steps, each
segment of the nephron is made up specialised cell types with their own sets of
signalling and transporter proteins. The filtration process is repeated about
12 times every hour with around 200 litres of blood being filtered during a
day. Aside from removing waste and maintaining the balance of molecular species
in the bloodstream, the kidneys also play a role in the activation of vitamin
D. Other important functions include synthesising the hormones erythropoietin,
which stimulates red blood cell production, and renin, which is part of the
pathway that controls fluid volume and the constriction of arteries to regulate
blood pressure.

Chronic kidney disease is a major health problem in Australia with 1 percent of
the population (237\thinspace800 people) diagnosed with it in 2017
[@Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics2018-uz] and it being considered a
contributory factor for 13 percent of deaths
[@Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics2018-ms]. Early stages of the disease can be
managed but once it becomes severe the only treatment options are dialysis,
which is expensive, time consuming and unpleasant, or a kidney transplant.
There are also a range of genetic developmental kidney disorders that have
limited treatment options and can profoundly affect quality of life.
Understanding how the kidney grows and develops is key to developing new
treatments that may improve kidney function or repair damage.

### Stages of development

The kidney develops from a region of the early embryo called the intermediate
mesoderm and occurs in three phases with a specific spatial and temporal order
[@Patel2013-vh]. The first phase results in the pronephros which consists of
6--10 pairs of tubules that forms the mature kidney in most primitive
vertebrates such as hagfish. By about the fourth week of human embryonic
development this structure dies off and is replaced by the mesonephros, which
is the form of kidney present in most fish and amphibians. The mesonephros is
functional during weeks 4--8 of human embryonic development before
degenerating, although parts of its duct system go on to form part of the male
reproductive system. The final phase of human kidney development results in the
metanephros which begins developing at around five weeks and continues to
around week 36 to become the permanent and functional kidney [@Little2015-wm].
Individual nephrons grow in a similar series of stages. Cells from the duct
that will become the ureter begin to invade the surrounding metanephric
mesenchyme forming a ureteric bud. Interactions between these cell types,
including Wnt signalling, cause mesenchymal cells to condense around the
ureteric bud forming a stem cell population known as the cap mesenchyme, which
expresses genes such as Six2 and Cited1. Cells from the cap mesenchyme first
form a renal vesicle, a primitive structure with a lumen, which extends to form
an S-shaped body (Figure \@ref(fig:nephrogenesis)). By this stage the lumen has
joined with the ureteric bud to form a continuous tubule. The s-shaped body
continues to elongate with podocytes beginning to develop and form a glomerulus
at one end and other specialised cells arising along the length of the tubule
to form the various nephron segments. Several signalling pathways and
cell--cell interactions are involved in this process, including Notch
signalling. While all nephrons form before birth they continue to elongate and
mature postnatally.

The nephron begins as a pre-tubular aggregate (PA) which forms a renal vesicle (RV), comma-shaped body (CSB), S-shaped body (SSB), capillary loop nephron and mature nephron. The connection between the forming nephron and the lumen of the adjacent ureteric epithelium forms at late renal vesicle stage.

Most of our understanding of kidney development comes from studies using mouse
models and other model species. While these have greatly added to our knowledge
they do not completely replicate human kidney development and there are known
to be significant differences in the developmental timeline, signalling
pathways and gene expression between species [@Lindstrom2018-tj]. To better
understand human kidney development we need models that reproduce the human
version of this process.

### Growing kidney organoids

One alternative model of human kidney development is to grow miniature organs
in a lab. Known as organoids, these tissues are grown from pluripotent stem
cells provided with the right sequence of conditions and growth factors
[@Tian2019-rv]. Naturally occurring embryonic stem cells can be used but a more
feasible approach is to reprogram mature cell types (typically fibroblasts from
skin samples) using a method discovered by Takahashi and Yamanaka
[@Takahashi2006-ho; @Nakagawa2008-bx]. Under this protocol, cells are supplied
with the transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2 and Klf4 using retroviral
transduction. The resulting cells have the ability to differentiate into any
cell type and are known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). By culturing
iPSCs under the right conditions the course of differentiation can be directed,
and protocols for growing a range of tissues have been developed including
stomach, intestine, liver, lung and brain [@Fatehullah2016-qw]. The first
protocol for growing kidney organoids was published in 2015 by Takasato et al.
(Figure \@ref(fig:organoids)) [@Takasato2015-zn].

```

(ref:scap-organoids) Diagram of the Takasato et al. kidney organoid protocol.

(ref:cap-organoids) Diagram of the Takasato et al. kidney organoid protocol. iPSCs are cultured on a plate in the presence of CHIR followed by FGF9. After about a week cells are formed into three-dimensional pellets and a short CHIR pulse is applied. The pellets continue to be cultured in FGF9 for a further 10 days before all growth factors are removed. The organoids now contain tubular structures replicating human nephrons. Adapted from Takasato et al. "Kidney organoids from human iPS cells contain multiple lineages and model human nephrogenesis" [@Takasato2015-zn].

Using this protocol, iPSCs are first grown on a plate where Wnt signalling is
induced by the presence of CHIR, an inhibitor of glycogen kinase synthase 3.
After several days of growth the growth factor FGF9 is added which is required
to form the intermediate mesoderm. Following several more days of growth the
cells are removed from the plate and formed into three dimensional pellets. A
short pulse of CHIR is added to again induce Wnt signalling and the pellets
continue to be cultured in the presence of FGF9. Growth factors are removed
after about five days of 3D culture and the organoids continue to grow for a
further two weeks, at which point tubular structures have formed. These kidney
organoids have been extensively characterised using both immunofluorescence
imaging and transcriptional profiling by RNA-seq. Imaging showed that the
tubules are segmented and express markers of podocytes, proximal tubule, distal
tubule and collecting duct, however individual tubules are not connected in the
same way they would be in a real kidney. By comparing RNA-seq profiles with
those from a range of developing tissues, the organoids from this protocol were
found to be most similar to trimester one and two foetal kidney
[@Takasato2015-zn]. While the bulk transcriptional profiles may be similar,
this analysis does not confirm that individual cells types are the same between
lab-grown kidney organoids and the true developing kidney. Further studies
using this protocol have shown that it is reproducible with organoids grown at
the same time having very similar transcriptional profiles, but organoids from
different batches can be significantly different, potentially due to
differences in the rate at which they develop [@Phipson2019-er].

While they are not a perfect model of a developing human kidney, organoids have
several advantages over other models [@Little2019-hf]. In particular, they have
great potential for uses in the modelling of developmental kidney diseases
[@Bartfeld2017-uo]. Cells from a patient with a particular mutation can be
reprogrammed and used to grow organoids that can then be used for functional
studies or drug screening. Alternatively, gene editing techniques can be used
to insert the mutation into an existing cell line or correct the mutation in
the patient line, allowing comparisons on the same genetic background. Modified
versions of the protocol that can produce much larger numbers of organoids, for
example by growing them in swirler cultures [@Kumar2019-tz], could potentially
be used to produce cells in sufficient numbers for cellular therapies.
Extensive work has been done to improve the protocol in other ways as well,
such as improving the maturation of the organoids or directing them more
towards particular segments. Overall, kidney organoids open up many
possibilities for studies to better understand kidney development and
potentially help develop new treatments for kidney disease.

### Kidney scRNA-seq studies

Several analyses of scRNA-seq from kidney tissues have already been performed,
including of developing and adult organs from human and mouse as well as kidney
organoids and specific kidney cell types [@Wilson2019-mw; @Brazovskaja2018-fj].
Park et al. analysed almost 58\thinspace000 cells from mouse kidneys and found
that disease-causing genetic mutations with similar phenotypes arise in the
same cell types [@Park2018-ub]. They also identified a new transitional cell
type in the collecting duct. Young et al. compared human foetal, paediatric and
adult kidney cells to cells from renal cancers and identified links to specific
cells types, including that Wilms tumours are similar to specific foetal cell
types and that adult renal cell carcinoma is related to a little-known proximal
tubule cell type [@Young2018-qd]. Lindström et al. focused on the developing
mouse and human kidney [@Lindstrom2018-mo] while Wu et al. examine kidney
organoids [@Wu2018-qi]. They found that organoid protocols produced a range of
cell types but that those cells were immature and 10--20 percent of cells came
from non-kidney lineages. Many of these were neuronal and their formation could
be limited by inhibiting the BDNF/NTRK2 pathway. In **Chapter \@ref(analysis)**
I analyse another organoid dataset generated by collaborators using the
Takasato protocol for the purposes of profiling the cell types present. I
demonstrate a range of analysis tools, focusing on the decisions that need to
be made during the analysis and the effects they might have on the results.
