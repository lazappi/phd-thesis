## The central dogma {#intro-dogma}

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of information within
a cell, from DNA to RNA to protein (Figure \@ref(fig:central-dogma)).
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the long-term data storage of the cell and has a
well-known double helix structure [@Watson1953-fx; @Wilkins1953-ik;
@Franklin1953-pe]. Each strand of the double helix consists of a series of
nucleotide molecules linked by phosphate groups. These nucleotides are made of
three subunits: a nitrogenous base, a deoxyribose sugar and a phosphate group.
DNA nucleotides come in four species, adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine,
which have different base subunits. The sugar and phosphate groups form the
backbone of each DNA strand and the two strands are bound together through
hydrogen bonds between matching nucleotides known as base pairs. Guanine forms
three hydrogen bonds with cytosine and adenine forms two with thymine. In
computing terms DNA is similar to a hard drive in that it provides stable,
consistent storage of important information.

(ref:cap-central-dogma) The central dogma of molecular biology. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the long-term data storage of the cell. To use this information a ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule is produced through a process called transcription. A mature messenger RNA (mRNA) requires splicing and addition of a ploy(A) tail. Proteins are created from mRNA through translation in the ribosome.

When the cell wants to use some of this information it produces a copy of it in
the form of a ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule through a process known as
transcription, similar to a computer loading information it wants to use into
its random access memory. Sections of DNA that encode functional information
are called genes. RNA is similar to a single strand of DNA except that the
deoxyribose sugar is replaced with ribose and the thymine nucleotide is
replaced with another nucleotide called uracil. Because it is single-stranded,
RNA does not have a double helix structure but it can form complex shapes by
binding to itself. A cell is able to create many copies of the same RNA
molecule and this is referred to as the expression level. By varying RNA
expression the activity of processes within a cell can be regulated. There are
several different types of RNA that serve different purposes. RNA molecules
that are transcribed from protein-coding genes are known as messenger RNA
(mRNA). Other types of RNA include ribosomal RNA (rRNA) which forms part of the
ribosome (the molecular machinery that manufactures proteins), transfer RNA
(tRNA) which carries amino acids to the ribosome, micro RNA (miRNA) which have
a role in regulating gene expression and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which are
also involved in regulation among other processes. Genes are made up of regions
that encode information (known as exons) that alternate with much larger
non-coding regions (introns).

When an mRNA molecule is transcribed it initially contains the intronic
sequences but these are removed through a process known as RNA splicing and a
sequence of adenine nucleotides (a poly(A) tail) is added where transcription
ends (the 3' end) to mark a mature mRNA molecule. This splicing process allows
multiple forms of a protein to be produced from a single gene by selecting
which exons are retained or removed. A mature mRNA transcript is converted to a
protein in a complex structure called the ribosome which is made up of
specialised RNA and proteins. The conversion process is known as translation
because the information encoded by nucleic acids in RNA is translated to
information stored as amino acids in the protein. Proteins complete most of the
work required to keep a cell functioning and can be compared to the programs
running on a computer. These functions require complex three dimensional
structures and include tasks such as sensing things in the external
environment, transporting nutrients into the cell, regulating the expression of
genes, constructing new proteins, recycling molecules and facilitating
metabolism. Understanding the molecules involved in the central dogma is
central to our understanding of how a cell works.
