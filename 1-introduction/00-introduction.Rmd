This introduction chapter provides the background and overview necessary for
understanding my work in this thesis, including an introduction to basic cell
biology and kidney development, the technologies we use to measure those
processes in the cell and the computational methods we use to analyse the data
these technologies produce. **Section \@ref(intro-dogma) - [The central
dogma]** describes how information flows within a cell and the molecules
involved in these processes. **Section \@ref(intro-RNAseq) - [RNA sequencing]**
covers the technologies used to measure the dynamic changes in some of these
molecules and the established computational methods that are commonly used to
extract meaning from this kind of data. In **Section \@ref(intro-scRNAseq) -
[Single-cell RNA sequencing]** I discuss new technologies that have enabled
measurements on the level of individual cells while **Section
\@ref(intro-analysis) - [Analysing scRNA-seq data]** outlines the types of
analysis that can be performed on this data and the tools and methods that
perform them. **Section \@ref(intro-kidney) - [Kidney development]** provides a
brief introduction to kidney structure and development and how it can be
studied using stem cell technologies. This section provides background for
**Chapter \@ref(analysis)** where I describe an analysis of a dataset from
developing kidney organoids. My introduction ends with **Section
\@ref(intro-overview) - [Thesis overview and aims]** which presents an overview
of my thesis aims and how I have completed them in the following chapters.
