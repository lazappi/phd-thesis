# Introduction {#introduction}

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of information within
a cell, from DNA to RNA to protein. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the long
term data storage of the cell and has a well known double helix structure
[@Watson1953-fx; @Wilkins1953-ik; @Franklin1953-pe]. Each strand of the double
helix consists of a series of nucleotide molecules linked by phosphate groups.
These nucleotides are made of three subunits a nitrogenous base, a deoxyribose
sugar and a phosphate group. Depending on the base subunit DNA nucleotides come
in four species, adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine. The sugar and
phosphate groups form the backbone of each DNA strand and the two strands are
bound together through hydrogen bonds between matching nucleotides known as
basepairs. Guanine forms three hydrogen bonds with cytosine and adenine forms
two with thymine. In computing terms DNA is similar to a hard drive in that it
provides stable, consistent storage of important information.

(ref:cap-central-dogma) The central dogma of molecular biology. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the long term data storage of the cell. To use this information a ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule is produced through a process called transcription. A mature messenger RNA (mRNA) requires splicing and addition of a ploy(A) tail. Proteins are created from mRNA through translation in the ribosome.

When the cell wants to use some of this information it produces a copy of it in
the form of a ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule through a process known as
transcription, similar to a computer loading information it wants to use into
it's random access memory. Sections of DNA that encode functional information
are called genes. RNA is similar to a single strand of DNA except that the
deoxyribose sugar is replaced with ribose and the thymine nucleotide is
replaced with another nucleotide called uracil. Because it is single-stranded
RNA does not have a double helix structure but it can form complex shapes by
binding to itself. There are several different types of RNA that serve
different purposes. RNA molecules that are transcribed from protein-coding
genes are known as messenger RNA (mRNA). Other types of RNA include ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) (that forms part of the ribosome, the molecular machinery that
manufactures proteins), transfer RNA (tRNA) which carry amino acids to the
ribosome, micro RNA which have a role in regulating gene expression and long
non-coding RNA which are also involved in regulation among other processes.
Genes are made up of regions that encode information (known as exons) that
alternate with much larger non-coding regions (introns).

When an mRNA molecule is transcribed it initially contains the intronic
sequences but these are removed through a process known as RNA splicing and a
sequence of adenine nucleotides (a poly(A) tail) is added to the end where
transcription ends (the 3' end) to mark a mature mRNA molecule. This splicing
process allows multiple forms of a protein to be produced from a single gene by
selecting which exons are retained or removed. A mature mRNA transcript is
converted to a protein in a complex structure called the ribosome which is made
up of specialised RNA and proteins. The conversion process is known as
translation because the information encoded by nucleic acids in RNA is
translated to information stored as amino acids in the protein. Proteins
complete most of the work required to keep a cell functioning and can be
compared to the programs running on a computer. These functions include tasks
such as sensing things in the external environment, transport nutrients into
the cell, regulating the expression of genes, constructing new proteins,
recycling molecules and metabolism. Understanding the molecules involved in the
central dogma is central to our understanding of how a cell functions.
