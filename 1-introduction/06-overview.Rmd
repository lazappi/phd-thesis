## Thesis overview and aims {#intro-overview}

The tools and techniques for analysing scRNA-seq data have developed rapidly
along with the technology. My thesis aims to chart the progress of these
methods over the last few years, contribute to the development in the field and
apply those methods to a scRNA-seq dataset to better understand the cellular
composition of kidney organoids. I have completed these aims in the following
ways:

1. Construction and maintenance of a database recording the development of
   scRNA-seq analysis methods and analysis of its contents
   (**Chapter \@ref(tools)**).

2. Development of a software package and method for easily simulating realistic
   scRNA-seq datasets that can be used for the evaluation and development of
   analysis methods (**Chapter \@ref(simulation)**).

3. Development of an algorithm for visualising clustering results at multiple
   resolutions that can be used to select clustering parameters and a software
   package that implements it (**Chapter \@ref(clust-trees)**).

4. Application of scRNA-seq analysis methods to a kidney organoid dataset in
   order to uncover and better understand the cells types that are present and
   demonstrate differences between approaches (**Chapter \@ref(analysis)**).
