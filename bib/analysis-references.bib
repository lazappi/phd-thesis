               be accessible in a readable format, and a platform must be
               available for widely distributing the data and code. In
               addition, both data and code need to be licensed permissively
               enough so that others can reproduce the work without a

  abstract  = "The cut-and-paste approach to writing statistical reports is not
               only tedious and laborious, but also can be harmful to
               scientific research, because it is inconvenient to reproduce the
               results. Dynamic Documents with R and knitr introduces a new
               approach via dynamic documents, i.e. integrating computing
               directly with reporting. A comprehensive guide to the R package
               knitr, the book covers examples, document editors, basic usage,
               detailed explanations of a wide range of options, tricks and
               solutions, extensions, and complete applications of this
               package. The book provides an overview of dynamic documents,
               introducing the idea of literate programming. It then explains
               the importance of dynamic documents to scientific research and
               its impact on reproducible research. Building on this, the
               author covers basic concepts, common text editors that support
               knitr, and the syntax for different document formats such as
               LaTeX, HTML, and Markdown before going on to discuss core
               functionality, how to control text and graphics output, caching
               mechanisms that can reduce computation time, and reuse of source
               code. He then explores advanced topics such as chunk hooks,
               integrating other languages such as Python and awk into one
               report in the knitr framework, and useful tricks that make it
               easier to write documents with knitr. Discussions of how to
               publish reports in a variety of formats, applications, and other
               tools complete the coverage. Suitable for both beginners and
               advanced users, this book shows you how to write reports in
               simple languages such as Markdown. The reports range from
               homework, projects, exams, books, blogs, and web pages to any
               documents related to statistical graphics, computing, and data
               analysis. While familiarity with LaTeX and HTML is helpful, the
               book requires no prior experience with advanced programs or
               languages. For beginners, the text provides enough features to
               get started on basic applications. For power users, the last
               several chapters enable an understanding of the extensibility of
               the knitr package.",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTRecent developments in data-driven science have led
               researchers to integrate data from several sources, over diverse
               experimental procedures, or databases. This alone poses a major
               challenge in truthfully visualizing data, especially when the
               number of data points varies between classes. To aid the
               representation of datasets with differing sample size, we have
               developed a new type of plot overcoming limitations of current
               standard visualization charts. SinaPlot is inspired by the strip
               chart and the violin plot and operates by letting the normalized
               density of points restrict the jitter along the x-axis. The plot
               displays the same contour as a violin plot but resembles a
               simple strip chart for a small number of data points. By
               normalizing jitter over all classes, the plot provides a fair
               representation for comparison between classes with a varying
               number of samples. In this way, the plot conveys information of
               both the number of data points, the density distribution,
               outliers and data spread in a very simple, comprehensible, and
               condensed format. The package for producing the plots is
               available for R through the CRAN network using base graphics
               package and as geom for ggplot through ggforce. We also provide
               access to a web-server accepting excel sheets to produce the
               plots (http://servers.binf.ku.dk:8890/sinaplot/).",

  abstract = "Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis
              task that has received widespread attention in the visualization
              community. The major challenge in this context is the
              combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the
              number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we
              introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the
              quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and
              aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating
              task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of
              aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the
              visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set
              membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout
              and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The
              matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated
              data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and
              intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived
              from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various
              measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections
              and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their
              associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries
              based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or
              driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We
              also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction
              methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address
              scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate
              its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.",

              of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization
              process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and
              ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is
              developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi
              users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We
              present here for the first time its functioning and settings.
              ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms
              used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical
              advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as
              the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and
              local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the
              Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we

              much feedback and is developed in order to provide many

              To facilitate many single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) analyses the set
              of genes is often reduced through feature selection, i.e. by
              removing genes only subject to technical noise. Results: We

              feature selection methods and two novel methods which take
              advantage of the prevalence of zeros (dropouts) in scRNASeq data

              particular, the number of groups present in a dataset is often
              unknown, and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm
              can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine
              the impact of varying clustering resolution, we present
              clustering trees. This visualization shows the relationships
              between clusters at multiple resolutions, allowing researchers to
              see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In
              addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform
              the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters.
              We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of
              simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris
              dataset and a complex single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset.
              Clustering trees can be produced using the clustree R package,
              available from CRAN and developed on GitHub.",

  abstract = "The transcriptome of single cells can reveal important
              information about cellular states and heterogeneity within
              populations of cells. Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing has
              facilitated expression profiling of large numbers of single cells
              in parallel. To fully exploit these data, it is critical that
              suitable computational approaches are developed. One key
              challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing
              populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of
              each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five established
              supervised machine learning methods and a custom-built predictor
              for allocating cells to their cell-cycle stage on the basis of
              their transcriptome. In particular, we assess the impact of
              different normalisation strategies and the usage of prior
              knowledge on the predictive power of the classifiers. We tested
              the methods on previously published datasets and found that a
              PCA-based approach and the custom predictor performed best.
              Moreover, our analysis shows that the performance depends
              strongly on normalisation and the usage of prior knowledge. Only
              by leveraging prior knowledge in form of cell-cycle annotated
              genes and by preprocessing the data using a rank-based
              normalisation, is it possible to robustly capture the
              transcriptional cell-cycle signature across different cell types,

              this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time,
              posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena

              quantification from dscRNA-seq (droplet-based single-cell

              that starts from sample-demultiplexed FASTQ files and generates
              gene-level counts for two popular droplet-based sequencing
              protocols (drop-seq [1], and 10x-chromium [2]). Importantly,
              alevin handles all processing internally, avoiding reliance on
              external pipeline programs, and the need to write large
              intermediate files to disk. Alevin adopts efficient algorithms

  abstract = "Single-cell RNA-seq allows quantification of biological
              heterogeneity across both discrete cell types and continuous cell
              differentiation transitions. We present approximate graph
              abstraction (AGA), an algorithm that reconciles the computational
              analysis strategies of clustering and trajectory inference by
              explaining cell-to-cell variation both in terms of discrete and
              continuous latent variables
              (https://github.com/theislab/graph\_abstraction). This enables to
              generate cellular maps of differentiation manifolds with complex
              topologies --- efficiently and robustly across different
              datasets. Approximate graph abstraction quantifies the
              connectivity of partitions of a neighborhood graph of single
              cells, thereby generating a much simpler abstracted graph whose
              nodes label the partitions. Together with a random walk-based
              distance measure, this generates a topology preserving map of
              single cells --- a partial coordinatization of data useful for
              exploring and explaining its variation. We use the abstracted
              graph to assess which subsets of data are better explained by
              discrete clusters than by a continuous variable, to trace gene
              expression changes along aggregated single-cell paths through
              data and to infer abstracted trees that best explain the global
              topology of data. We demonstrate the power of the method by
              reconstructing differentiation processes with high numbers of
              branchings from single-cell gene expression datasets and by
              identifying biological trajectories from single-cell imaging data
              using a deep-learning based distance metric. Along with the
              method, we introduce measures for the connectivity of graph
              partitions, generalize random-walk based distance measures to
              disconnected graphs and introduce a path-based measure for
              topological similarity between graphs. Graph abstraction is
              computationally efficient and provides speedups of at least 30
              times when compared to algorithms for the inference of lineage
              trees.",

  abstract  = "1. 1 Welcome to ggplot2 ggplot2 is an R package for producing
               statistical, or data, graphics, but it is unlike most other
               graphics packages because it has a deep underlying grammar. This
               grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2005), is
               composed of a set of independent components that can be composed
               in many di?erent ways. This makesggplot2 very powerful, because
               you are not limited to a set of pre-speci?ed graphics, but you
               can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your
               problem. This may sound overwhelming, but because there is a
               simple set of core principles and very few special cases,
               ggplot2 is also easy to learn (although it may take a little
               time to forget your preconceptions from other graphics tools).
               Practically,ggplot2 provides beautiful, hassle-free plots, that
               take care of ?ddly details like drawing legends. The plots can
               be built up iteratively and edited later. A carefully chosen set
               of defaults means that most of the time you can produce a
               publication-quality graphic in seconds, but if you do have
               special formatting requirements, a comprehensive theming system
               makes it easy to do what you want. Instead of spending time
               making your graph look pretty, you can focus on creating a graph
               that best reveals the messages in your data.",

  abstract = "A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of
              read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the
              ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple
              treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking
              full account of biological variation. Biological variation
              between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical
              variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel
              empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific
              variability, even when there are relatively few biological
              replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline
              is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project.
              A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability
              of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential
              expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific
              expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow
              for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common
              dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance
              and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with
              inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on
              changes that are consistent between biological replicates.
              Parallel computational approaches are developed to make
              non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the
              application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and
              practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
              profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of
              biological variability in complex situations. When variation is
              gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous
              compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or
              separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also
              be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications,

              increasingly used to study gene expression at the level of
              individual cells. However, preparing raw sequence data for
              further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases,
              artifacts and other sources of unwanted variation are present in
              the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on
              pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization. RESULTS:
              We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate
              rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalization and
              visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a
              convenient, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads
              into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream
              analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for

              (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the
              near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the
              fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression
              studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that
              counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different
              across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software
              package for examining differential expression of replicated count
              data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both
              biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are
              used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts,
              improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be
              used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
              at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.
              The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,
