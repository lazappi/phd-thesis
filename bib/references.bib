              seed-and-vote}",
  author   = "Liao, Yang and Smyth, Gordon K and Shi, Wei",
  abstract = "Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data
              from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly
              simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping
              reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped
              genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a
              relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
              extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the
              optimal location. When the read length is <160 bp, overlapping
              subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are
              then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information
              between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The
              strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already
              been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
              sensitive because no individual subread is required to map
              exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by
              other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be
              supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends
              easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain
              sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It
              scales up efficiently for longer reads.",

  abstract = "HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of

              RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme based
              on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM)
              index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a
              whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local
              FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's
              hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM
              indexes, each representing a genomic region of âˆ¼64,000 bp. Tests
              on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest
              system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than
              any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT
              requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing is now
              widely used in a number of applications surveying the whole
              transcriptomes of cells and tissues. The recent introduction of
              ribosomal RNA depletion protocols, such as RiboZero, has extended
              the view of the polyadenylated transcriptome to the poly(A)-
              fraction of the RNA. However, substantial amounts of intronic
              transcriptional activity has been reported in RiboZero protocols,
              raising issues regarding their potential nuclear origin and the
              impact on the actual sequence depth in exonic regions. RESULTS:
              Using HEK293 human cells as source material, we assessed here the
              impact of the two commonly used RNA extraction methods and of the
              library construction protocols (rRNA depletion versus mRNA) on 1)
              the relative abundance of intronic reads and 2) on the estimation
              of gene expression values. We benchmarked the rRNA
              depletion-based sequencing with a specific analysis of the
              cytoplasmic and nuclear transcriptome fractions, suggesting that
              the large majority of the intronic reads correspond to
              unprocessed nuclear transcripts rather than to independent
              transcriptional units. We show that Qiagen or TRIzol extraction
              methods retain differentially nuclear RNA species, and that
              consequently, rRNA depletion-based RNA sequencing protocols are
              particularly sensitive to the extraction methods. CONCLUSIONS: We
              could show that the combination of Trizol-based RNA extraction
              with rRNA depletion sequencing protocols led to the largest
              fraction of intronic reads, after the sequencing of the nuclear
              transcriptome. We discuss here the impact of the various
              strategies on gene expression and alternative splicing estimation
              measures. Further, we propose guidelines and a double selection
              strategy for minimizing the expression biases, without loss of
              information.",

  abstract = "RNA Seq provides unparalleled levels of information about the
              transcriptome including precise expression levels over a wide
              dynamic range. It is essential to understand how technical
              variation impacts the quality and interpretability of results,
              how potential errors could be introduced by the protocol, how the
              source of RNA affects transcript detection, and how all of these
              variations can impact the conclusions drawn. Multiple human RNA
              samples were used to assess RNA fragmentation, RNA fractionation,
              cDNA synthesis, and single versus multiple tag counting. Though
              protocols employing polyA RNA selection generate the highest
              number of non-ribosomal reads and the most precise measurements
              for coding transcripts, such protocols were found to detect only
              a fraction of the non-ribosomal RNA in human cells. PolyA RNA
              excludes thousands of annotated and even more unannotated
              transcripts, resulting in an incomplete view of the
              transcriptome. Ribosomal-depleted RNA provides a more
              cost-effective method for generating complete transcriptome
              coverage. Expression measurements using single tag counting
              provided advantages for assessing gene expression and for
              detecting short RNAs relative to multi-read protocols. Detection
              of short RNAs was also hampered by RNA fragmentation. Thus, this
              work will help researchers choose from among a range of options

              transcriptional stress responses. METHODS: We compared
              single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using the DropSeq platform
              with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using
              sNuc-DropSeq, DroNc-seq, and 10X Chromium platforms on adult
              mouse kidney. We validated snRNA-seq on fibrotic kidney from mice
              14 days after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery.
              RESULTS: A total of 11,391 transcriptomes were generated in the
              comparison phase. We identified ten clusters in the scRNA-seq
              dataset, but glomerular cell types were absent, and one cluster
              consisted primarily of artifactual dissociation-induced stress
              response genes. By contrast, snRNA-seq from all three platforms
              captured a diversity of kidney cell types that were not
              represented in the scRNA-seq dataset, including glomerular
              podocytes, mesangial cells, and endothelial cells. No stress
              response genes were detected. Our snRNA-seq protocol yielded
              20-fold more podocytes compared with published scRNA-seq datasets
              (2.4\% versus 0.12\%, respectively). Unexpectedly, single-cell
              and single-nucleus platforms had equivalent gene detection
              sensitivity. For validation, analysis of frozen day 14 UUO kidney
              revealed rare juxtaglomerular cells, novel activated proximal
              tubule and fibroblast cell states, and previously unidentified
              tubulointerstitial signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: snRNA-seq
              achieves comparable gene detection to scRNA-seq in adult kidney,
              and it also has substantial advantages, including reduced
              dissociation bias, compatibility with frozen samples, elimination
              of dissociation-induced transcriptional stress responses, and
              successful performance on inflamed fibrotic kidney.",

              identity. Single-cell technologies are useful for deconstructing
              the considerable heterogeneity that emerges during lineage
              conversion. However, lineage relationships are typically lost
              during cell processing, complicating trajectory reconstruction.
              Here we present 'CellTagging', a combinatorial cell-indexing
              methodology that enables parallel capture of clonal history and
              cell identity, in which sequential rounds of cell labelling
              enable the construction of multi-level lineage trees. CellTagging
              and longitudinal tracking of fibroblast to induced endoderm
              progenitor reprogramming reveals two distinct trajectories: one
              leading to successfully reprogrammed cells, and one leading to a
              'dead-end' state, paths determined in the earliest stages of
              lineage conversion. We find that expression of a putative
              methyltransferase, Mettl7a1, is associated with the successful
              reprogramming trajectory; adding Mettl7a1 to the reprogramming
              cocktail increases the yield of induced endoderm progenitors.
              Together, these results demonstrate the utility of our
              lineage-tracing method for revealing the dynamics of direct

              magnetic microbeads. Evaluating the performance of this method
              using real-time PCR demonstrated that it efficiently recovered
              genomic DNA and total RNA. Thorough data quality assessments
              showed that DNA and RNA simultaneously fractionated by the SIDR
              method were suitable for genome and transcriptome sequencing
              analysis at the single-cell level. The integration of single-cell
              genome and transcriptome sequencing by SIDR (SIDR-seq) showed
              that genetic alterations such as copy-number and single
              nucleotide variations were much accurately captured by
              single-cell SIDR-seq compared to that by conventional single-cell
              RNA-seq, although copy-number variations positively correlated
              with the corresponding gene expression levels. These results
              suggest that SIDR-seq is potentially a powerful tool to reveal
              genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic information inferred from
              gene expression patterns at the single-cell level.",

               Understanding how these different characteristics are
               interrelated at the single-cell level has been difficult because
               of the lack of techniques for multimodal profiling of individual
               cells. We recently developed Patch-seq, a technique that
               combines whole-cell patch-clamp recording, immunohistochemistry,
               and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively
               profile single neurons from mouse brain slices. Here, we present
               a detailed step-by-step protocol, including modifications to the
               patching mechanics and recording procedure, reagents and
               recipes, procedures for immunohistochemistry, and other tips to
               assist researchers in obtaining high-quality morphological,
               electrophysiological, and transcriptomic data from single

               researchers to explore the multidimensional phenotypic
               variability among neurons and to correlate gene expression with
               phenotype at the level of single cells. The entire procedure can

              integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression
              experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex
              experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
              the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
              has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential
              expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
              The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading,
              normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities
              of limma have been significantly expanded in two important
              directions. First, the package can now perform both differential
              expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing
              (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously
              restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
              well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
              microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package
              is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression
              analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
              terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
              expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
              biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
              article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package,
              summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on

              read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the
              ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple
              treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking
              full account of biological variation. Biological variation
              between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical
              variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel
              empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific
              variability, even when there are relatively few biological
              replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline
              is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project.
              A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability
              of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential
              expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific
              expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow
              for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common
              dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance
              and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with
              inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on
              changes that are consistent between biological replicates.
              Parallel computational approaches are developed to make
              non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the
              application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and
              practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
              profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of
              biological variability in complex situations. When variation is
              gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous
              compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or
              separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also
              be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications,

              (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the
              near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the
              fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression
              studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that
              counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different
              across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software
              package for examining differential expression of replicated count
              data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both
              biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are
              used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts,
              improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be
              used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
              at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.
              The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,
              such as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is

              technologies have become powerful tools to study RNA and DNA
              methylation profiles of single cells at a genome-wide scale. A
              major challenge has been to understand the direct correlation of
              DNA methylation and gene expression within single-cells. Due to
              large cell-to-cell variability and the lack of direct
              measurements of transcriptome and methylome of the same cell, the
              association is still unclear. RESULTS: Here, we describe a novel
              method (scMT-seq) that simultaneously profiles both DNA methylome
              and transcriptome from the same cell. In sensory neurons, we
              consistently identify transcriptome and methylome heterogeneity
              among single cells but the majority of the expression variance is
              not explained by proximal promoter methylation, with the
              exception of genes that do not contain CpG islands. By contrast,
              gene body methylation is positively associated with gene
              expression for only those genes that contain a CpG island
              promoter. Furthermore, using single nucleotide polymorphism
              patterns from our hybrid mouse model, we also find positive
              correlation of allelic gene body methylation with allelic
              expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our method can be used to detect
              transcriptome, methylome, and single nucleotide polymorphism

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is
              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
              lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
              that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching
              procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in
              mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2
              $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core
              server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity
              and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of
              canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and
              chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
              full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse
              transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
              experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions
              with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of
              the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR
              is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source

               for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation
