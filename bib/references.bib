              transcriptomics}",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Single-cell transcriptomics allows researchers to
              investigate complex communities of heterogeneous cells. It can be
              applied to stem cells and their descendants in order to chart the
              progression from multipotent progenitors to fully differentiated
              cells. While a variety of statistical and computational methods
              have been proposed for inferring cell lineages, the problem of
              accurately characterizing multiple branching lineages remains
              difficult to solve. RESULTS: We introduce Slingshot, a novel
              method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes from
              single-cell gene expression data. In previously published
              datasets, Slingshot correctly identifies the biological signal
              for one to three branching trajectories. Additionally, our
              simulation study shows that Slingshot infers more accurate
              pseudotimes than other leading methods. CONCLUSIONS: Slingshot is
              a uniquely robust and flexible tool which combines the highly
              stable techniques necessary for noisy single-cell data with the
              ability to identify multiple trajectories. Accurate lineage
              inference is a critical step in the identification of dynamic
              temporal gene expression.",

              seed-and-vote}",
  author   = "Liao, Yang and Smyth, Gordon K and Shi, Wei",
  abstract = "Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data
              from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly
              simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping
              reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped
              genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a
              relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
              extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the
              optimal location. When the read length is <160 bp, overlapping
              subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are
              then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information
              between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The
              strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already
              been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
              sensitive because no individual subread is required to map
              exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by
              other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be
              supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends
              easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain
              sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It
              scales up efficiently for longer reads.",

              on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM)
              index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a
              whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local
              FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's
              hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM
              indexes, each representing a genomic region of âˆ¼64,000 bp. Tests

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing is now
              widely used in a number of applications surveying the whole
              transcriptomes of cells and tissues. The recent introduction of
              ribosomal RNA depletion protocols, such as RiboZero, has extended
              the view of the polyadenylated transcriptome to the poly(A)-
              fraction of the RNA. However, substantial amounts of intronic
              transcriptional activity has been reported in RiboZero protocols,
              raising issues regarding their potential nuclear origin and the
              impact on the actual sequence depth in exonic regions. RESULTS:
              Using HEK293 human cells as source material, we assessed here the
              impact of the two commonly used RNA extraction methods and of the
              library construction protocols (rRNA depletion versus mRNA) on 1)
              the relative abundance of intronic reads and 2) on the estimation
              of gene expression values. We benchmarked the rRNA
              depletion-based sequencing with a specific analysis of the
              cytoplasmic and nuclear transcriptome fractions, suggesting that
              the large majority of the intronic reads correspond to
              unprocessed nuclear transcripts rather than to independent
              transcriptional units. We show that Qiagen or TRIzol extraction
              methods retain differentially nuclear RNA species, and that
              consequently, rRNA depletion-based RNA sequencing protocols are
              particularly sensitive to the extraction methods. CONCLUSIONS: We
              could show that the combination of Trizol-based RNA extraction
              with rRNA depletion sequencing protocols led to the largest
              fraction of intronic reads, after the sequencing of the nuclear
              transcriptome. We discuss here the impact of the various
              strategies on gene expression and alternative splicing estimation
              measures. Further, we propose guidelines and a double selection
              strategy for minimizing the expression biases, without loss of
              information.",

  abstract = "RNA Seq provides unparalleled levels of information about the
              transcriptome including precise expression levels over a wide
              dynamic range. It is essential to understand how technical
              variation impacts the quality and interpretability of results,
              how potential errors could be introduced by the protocol, how the
              source of RNA affects transcript detection, and how all of these
              variations can impact the conclusions drawn. Multiple human RNA
              samples were used to assess RNA fragmentation, RNA fractionation,
              cDNA synthesis, and single versus multiple tag counting. Though
              protocols employing polyA RNA selection generate the highest
              number of non-ribosomal reads and the most precise measurements
              for coding transcripts, such protocols were found to detect only
              a fraction of the non-ribosomal RNA in human cells. PolyA RNA
              excludes thousands of annotated and even more unannotated
              transcripts, resulting in an incomplete view of the

              biologically relevant information while removing genes only
              subject to technical noise. As it is frequently performed prior
              to dimensionality reduction, clustering and pseudotime analyses,
              feature selection can have a major impact on the results. Several
              different approaches have been proposed for unsupervised feature
              selection from unprocessed single-cell expression matrices, most
              based upon identifying highly variable genes in the dataset. We
              present two methods which take advantage of the prevalence of
              zeros (dropouts) in scRNASeq data to identify features. We show
              that dropout-based feature selection outperforms variance-based

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A challenge for single-cell genomic studies in kidney
              and other solid tissues is generating a high-quality single-cell
              suspension that contains rare or difficult-to-dissociate cell
              types and is free of both RNA degradation and artifactual
              transcriptional stress responses. METHODS: We compared
              single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using the DropSeq platform
              with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using
              sNuc-DropSeq, DroNc-seq, and 10X Chromium platforms on adult
              mouse kidney. We validated snRNA-seq on fibrotic kidney from mice
              14 days after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery.
              RESULTS: A total of 11,391 transcriptomes were generated in the
              comparison phase. We identified ten clusters in the scRNA-seq
              dataset, but glomerular cell types were absent, and one cluster
              consisted primarily of artifactual dissociation-induced stress
              response genes. By contrast, snRNA-seq from all three platforms
              captured a diversity of kidney cell types that were not
              represented in the scRNA-seq dataset, including glomerular
              podocytes, mesangial cells, and endothelial cells. No stress
              response genes were detected. Our snRNA-seq protocol yielded
              20-fold more podocytes compared with published scRNA-seq datasets
              (2.4\% versus 0.12\%, respectively). Unexpectedly, single-cell
              and single-nucleus platforms had equivalent gene detection
              sensitivity. For validation, analysis of frozen day 14 UUO kidney
              revealed rare juxtaglomerular cells, novel activated proximal
              tubule and fibroblast cell states, and previously unidentified
              tubulointerstitial signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: snRNA-seq
              achieves comparable gene detection to scRNA-seq in adult kidney,
              and it also has substantial advantages, including reduced
              dissociation bias, compatibility with frozen samples, elimination
              of dissociation-induced transcriptional stress responses, and

              identity. Single-cell technologies are useful for deconstructing
              the considerable heterogeneity that emerges during lineage
              conversion. However, lineage relationships are typically lost
              during cell processing, complicating trajectory reconstruction.
              Here we present 'CellTagging', a combinatorial cell-indexing
              methodology that enables parallel capture of clonal history and
              cell identity, in which sequential rounds of cell labelling

              leading to successfully reprogrammed cells, and one leading to a
              'dead-end' state, paths determined in the earliest stages of
              lineage conversion. We find that expression of a putative
              methyltransferase, Mettl7a1, is associated with the successful
              reprogramming trajectory; adding Mettl7a1 to the reprogramming
              cocktail increases the yield of induced endoderm progenitors.
              Together, these results demonstrate the utility of our

  abstract = "Background: Single-cell RNASeq is a powerful tool for measuring
              gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. A
              significant challenge in the analysis of this data is the large
              amount of zero values, representing either missing data or no
              expression. Several imputation approaches have been proposed to
              deal with this issue, but since these methods generally rely on
              structure inherent to the dataset under consideration they may
              not provide any additional information. Methods: We evaluated the
              risk of generating false positive or irreproducible results when
              imputing data with five different methods. We applied each method
              to a variety of simulated datasets as well as to permuted real
              single-cell RNASeq datasets and consider the number of false
              positive gene-gene correlations and differentially expressed
              genes. Using matched 10X Chromium and Smartseq2 data from the
              Tabula Muris database we examined the reproducibility of markers
              before and after imputation. Results: The extent of
              false-positive signals introduced by imputation varied
              considerably by method. Data smoothing based methods, MAGIC and
              knn-smooth, generated a very high number of false-positives in
              both real and simulated data. Model-based imputation methods
              typically generated fewer false-positives but this varied greatly
              depending on how well datasets conformed to the underlying model.
              Furthermore, only SAVER exhibited reproducibility comparable to
              unimputed data across matched data. Conclusions: Imputation of
              single-cell RNASeq data introduces circularity that can generate
              false-positive results. Thus, statistical tests applied to
              imputed data should be treated with care. Additional filtering by
              effect size can reduce but not fully eliminate these effects. Of
              the methods we considered, SAVER was the least likely to generate
              false or irreproducible results, thus should be favoured over
              alternatives if imputation is necessary.",

              transformative approaches for large-scale population surveys of
              cellular diversity in heterogeneous primary tissues. However, the

              enable a comprehensive examination of organs, developmental
              stages, and individuals. RESULTS: To examine the relationship
              between sampled cell numbers and transcriptional heterogeneity in
              the context of unbiased cell type classification, we explored the
              population structure of a publicly available 1.3 million cell
              dataset from E18.5 mouse brain and validated our findings in
              published data from adult mice. We propose a computational
              framework for inferring the saturation point of cluster discovery
              in a single-cell mRNA-seq experiment, centered around cluster
              preservation in downsampled datasets. In addition, we introduce a
              ``complexity index,'' which characterizes the heterogeneity of
              cells in a given dataset. Using Cajal-Retzius cells as an example
              of a limited complexity dataset, we explored whether the detected
              biological distinctions relate to technical clustering.
              Surprisingly, we found that clustering distinctions carrying
              biologically interpretable meaning are achieved with far fewer
              cells than the originally sampled, though technical saturation of
              rare populations such as Cajal-Retzius cells is not achieved. We
              additionally validated these findings with a recently published
              atlas of cell types across mouse organs and again find using
              subsampling that a much smaller number of cells recapitulates the
              cluster distinctions of the complete dataset. CONCLUSIONS:
              Together, these findings suggest that most of the biologically
              interpretable cell types from the 1.3 million cell database can
              be recapitulated by analyzing 50,000 randomly selected cells,
              indicating that instead of profiling few individuals at high
              ``cellular coverage,'' cell atlas studies may instead benefit
              from profiling more individuals, or many time points at lower
              cellular coverage and then further enriching for populations of
              interest. This strategy is ideal for scenarios where cost and
              time are limited, though extremely rare populations of interest
              (< 1\%) may be identifiable only with much higher cell numbers.",

              for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the
              single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an
              scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing
              clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
              (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends
              on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary
              decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an
              experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be
              incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We
              therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely,
              classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model
              transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This
              approach can complement existing methods, and-in some cases-even
              replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires
              selecting informative features and training a classifier. The
              specific implementation for the framework that we propose,
              designated ''CaSTLe-classification of single cells by transfer
              learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and
              an XGBoost classification model built on these features.
              Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and
              classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark
              methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification
              accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional
              advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large
              datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types
              using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very
              small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential
              applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq

              subclonal populations of cells that are defined by distinct
              mutations. Subclones can have unique phenotypes that influence
              disease progression, but these phenotypes are difficult to
              characterize: subclones usually cannot be physically purified,
              and bulk gene expression measurements obscure interclonal
              differences. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has revealed
              transcriptional heterogeneity within a variety of tumor types,
              but it is unclear how this expression heterogeneity relates to
              subclonal genetic events - for example, whether particular
              expression clusters correspond to mutationally defined subclones.
              To address this question, we developed an approach that
              integrates enhanced whole genome sequencing (eWGS) with the 10x
              Genomics Chromium Single Cell 59 Gene Expression workflow
              (scRNA-seq) to directly link expressed mutations with
              transcriptional profiles at single cell resolution. Using bone
              marrow samples from five cases of primary human Acute Myeloid
              Leukemia (AML), we generated WGS and scRNA-seq data for each
              case. Duplicate single cell libraries representing a median of
              20,474 cells per case were generated from the bone marrow of each
              patient. Although the libraries were 59 biased, we detected
              expressed mutations in cDNAs at distances up to 10 kbp from the
              59 ends of well-expressed genes, allowing us to identify hundreds
              to thousands of cells with AML-specific somatic mutations in
              every case. This data made it possible to distinguish AML cells
              (including normal-karyotype AML cells) from surrounding normal
              cells, to study tumor differentiation and intratumoral expression
              heterogeneity, to identify expression signatures associated with
              subclonal mutations, and to find cell surface markers that could
              be used to purify subclones for further study. The data also
              revealed transcriptional heterogeneity that occurred
              independently of subclonal mutations, suggesting that additional
              factors drive epigenetic heterogeneity. This integrative approach
              for connecting genotype to phenotype in AML cells is broadly
              applicable for analysis of any sample that is phenotypically and

              expressions [single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)] have enabled
              transcriptome profiling on individual cells from complex samples.
              A common goal in scRNA-seq data analysis is to discover and
              characterise cell types, typically through clustering methods.
              The quality of the clustering therefore plays a critical role in
              biological discovery. While numerous clustering algorithms have
              been proposed for scRNA-seq data, fundamentally they all rely on
              a similarity metric for categorising individual cells. Although
              several studies have compared the performance of various
              clustering algorithms for scRNA-seq data, currently there is no
              benchmark of different similarity metrics and their influence on
              scRNA-seq data clustering. Here, we compared a panel of
              similarity metrics on clustering a collection of annotated
              scRNA-seq datasets. Within each dataset, a stratified subsampling
              procedure was applied and an array of evaluation measures was
              employed to assess the similarity metrics. This produced a highly
              reliable and reproducible consensus on their performance
              assessment. Overall, we found that correlation-based metrics
              (e.g. Pearson's correlation) outperformed distance-based metrics
              (e.g. Euclidean distance). To test if the use of
              correlation-based metrics can benefit the recently published
              clustering techniques for scRNA-seq data, we modified a
              state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR) using
              Pearson's correlation as a similarity measure and found
              significant performance improvement over Euclidean distance on
              scRNA-seq data clustering. These findings demonstrate the
              importance of similarity metrics in clustering scRNA-seq data and
              highlight Pearson's correlation as a favourable choice. Further
              comparison on different scRNA-seq library preparation protocols
              suggests that they may also affect clustering performance.

  abstract = "Background: The commercially available 10x Genomics protocol to
              generate droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is
              enjoying growing popularity among researchers. Fundamental to the
              analysis of such scRNA-seq data is the ability to cluster similar
              or same cells into non-overlapping groups. Many competing methods
              have been proposed for this task, but there is currently little
              guidance with regards to which method to use. Methods: Here we
              use one gold standard 10x Genomics dataset, generated from the
              mixture of three cell lines, as well as three silver standard 10x
              Genomics datasets generated from peripheral blood mononuclear
              cells to examine not only the accuracy but also robustness of a
              dozen methods. Results: We found that some methods, including
              Seurat and Cell Ranger, outperform other methods, although
              performance seems to be dependent on the complexity of the
              studied system. Furthermore, we found that solutions produced by
              different methods have little in common with each other.
              Conclusions: In light of this, we conclude that the choice of
              clustering tool crucially determines interpretation of scRNA-seq
              data generated by 10x Genomics. Hence practitioners and consumers
              should remain vigilant about the outcome of 10x Genomics

              cellular gene expression that cannot be observed in whole-tissue
              analysis. Allele-specific expression in single cells can provide
              an even richer picture of the stochastic and dynamic features of
              gene expression. Single-cell technologies are moving toward
              sequencing larger numbers of cells with low depth of coverage per
              cell. Low coverage results in increased sampling variability and
              frequent occurrence of zero counts for genes that are expressed
              at low levels or that are dynamically expressed in short bursts.
              The problems associated with low coverage are exacerbated in
              allele-specific analysis by the almost universal practice of
              discarding reads that cannot be unambiguously aligned to one
              allele of one gene (multi-reads). We demonstrate that discarding
              multi-reads leads to higher variability in estimates of allelic
              proportions, an increased frequency of sampling zeros, and can
              lead to spurious findings of dynamic and monoallelic gene
              expression. We propose a weighted-allocation method of counting
              reads that substantially improves estimation of allelic
              proportions and reduces spurious zeros in the allele-specific
              read counts. We further demonstrate that combining information
              across cells using a hierarchical mixture model reduces sampling
              variability without sacrificing cell-to-cell heterogeneity. We
              applied our approach to track changes in the allele-specific
              expression patterns of cells sampled over a developmental time

              development and application of a broad range of clustering
              methods, based on various underlying algorithms. Here, we provide
              a systematic and extensible performance evaluation of 12
              clustering algorithms, including both methods developed
              explicitly for scRNA-seq data and more general-purpose methods.
              The methods were evaluated using 9 publicly available scRNA-seq
              data sets as well as three simulations with varying degree of
              cluster separability. The same feature selection approaches were
              used for all methods, allowing us to focus on the investigation
              of the performance of the clustering algorithms themselves. We
              evaluated the ability of recovering known subpopulations, the
              stability and the run time of the methods. Additionally, we
              investigated whether the performance could be improved by
              generating consensus partitions from multiple individual

              highly specific cell types in many human tissues, as well as both
              primary and stem cell-derived cell lines. An important facet of
              these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional
              signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this
              information can be used to classify an unknown cell based on its
              transcriptional profile; and clearly, the ability to accurately
              predict a cell type and any pathologic-related state will play a
              critical role in the early diagnosis of disease and decisions
              around the personalized treatment for patients. Here we present a
              new generalizable method (scPred) for prediction of cell type(s),
              using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a
              reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning classification.
              scPred solves several problems associated with the identification
              of individual gene feature selection and is able to capture
              subtle effects of many genes, increasing the overall variance
              explained by the model, and correspondingly improving the
              prediction accuracy. We apply scPred to scRNA-seq data from
              pancreatic tissue, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating
              dendritic cells, and show that scPred is able to classify cell
              subtypes with an accuracy of 96.1-99.2\%. Furthermore, we
              demonstrate that the feature selection step of scPred is able to
              discriminate from both transcriptional variation between
              single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, and between laboratory
              batch effects, and still predict cell subtype with an accuracy
              greater the 96\%. Collectively, our results demonstrate the
              utility of scPred as a single cell prediction method that can be
              used for a wide variety of applications. The generalized method

              The presence of doublets can lead to spurious biological

              DoubletFinder infers the putative gene expression profile of real

              Although genetic variation is a well-studied source of
              intratumoral heterogeneity, the functional impact of most genetic
              alterations remains unclear. Even less understood is the relative
              importance of other factors influencing heterogeneity, such as
              epigenetic state or tumor microenvironment. To investigate the
              relationship between genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity in
              a context of cancer progression, we devised a computational
              approach called HoneyBADGER to identify copy number variation and
              loss-of-heterozygosity in individual cells from single-cell
              RNA-sequencing data. By integrating allele and normalized

              the presence of subclone-specific alterations in individual cells

              progressive multiple myeloma patient to identify major genetic
              subclones that exhibit distinct transcriptional signatures

              transcriptional subpopulations within these tumors did not line

              by alternative, non-clonal mechanisms. These results highlight

  abstract = "Background: Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments typically
              analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the
              cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early
              introduction of sample-specific barcodes (BCs) and the
              amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers
              (UMIs). Thus the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs
              to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI.
              Findings: zUMIs is a pipeline that can handle both known and
              random BCs and also efficiently collapses UMIs, either just for
              Exon mapping reads or for both Exon and Intron mapping reads. If
              BC annotation is missing, zUMIs can accurately detect intact
              cells from the distribution of sequencing reads. Another unique
              feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function, that
              facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes, but also
              allows to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to
              saturation. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analysed a
              single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35\% of
              all reads map to Introns. We furthermore show that these intronic
              reads are informative about expression levels, significantly
              increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster

              data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use
              BCs and UMIs and is the most feature-rich, fast and user-friendly

              analyze both the genome and transcriptome in the same cell. Here,
              we report a novel method for simultaneous isolation of genomic
              DNA and total RNA (SIDR) from single cells, achieving high
              recovery rates with minimal cross-contamination, as is crucial
              for accurate description and integration of the single-cell
              genome and transcriptome. For reliable and efficient separation
              of genomic DNA and total RNA from single cells, the method uses
              hypotonic lysis to preserve nuclear lamina integrity and
              subsequently captures the cell lysate using antibody-conjugated
              magnetic microbeads. Evaluating the performance of this method

              single-cell SIDR-seq compared to that by conventional single-cell
              RNA-seq, although copy-number variations positively correlated
              with the corresponding gene expression levels. These results

  abstract = "Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such
              as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of
              cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances
              permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell
              level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used
              and numerous publications are based on data produced with this
              technology. However, RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly
              different. In particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority of
              reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be
              either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time
              of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing RNA, but
              not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing
              technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes
              reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially
              across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it
              remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is
              being driven by technical rather than biological variation.
              Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects,
              have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput
              technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in
              published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an
              assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and
              demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial
              percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability.
              Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported
              zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that
              scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is
              greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data
              problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation
              varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical
              cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological
              results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects
              and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.",

               Understanding how these different characteristics are

               of the lack of techniques for multimodal profiling of individual

              batch effects can hamper data integration and interpretation. The
              success of batch effect correction is often evaluated by visual
              inspection of dimension reduced representations such as principal
              component analysis. This is inherently imprecise due to the high
              number of genes and non-normal distribution of gene expression.
              Here, we present a k-nearest neighbour batch effect test (kBET,
              https://github.com/theislab/kBET) to quantitatively measure batch
              effects. kBET is easier to interpret, more sensitive and more
              robust than visual evaluation and other measures of batch
              effects. We use kBET to assess commonly used batch regression and
              normalisation approaches, and quantify the extent to which they
              remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. Our
              results illustrate that batch correction based on
              log-transformation or scran pooling followed by ComBat reduced
              the batch effect while preserving structure across data sets.
              Finally we show that kBET can pinpoint successful data
              integration methods across multiple data sets, in this case from
              different publications all charting mouse embryonic development.
              This has important implications for future data integration

  abstract = "limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an
              integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression
              experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex
              experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
              the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
              has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential
              expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
              The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading,
              normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities
              of limma have been significantly expanded in two important
              directions. First, the package can now perform both differential
              expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing
              (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously
              restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
              well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
              microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package
              is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression
              analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
              terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
              expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
              biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
              article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package,
              summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on
              recent enhancements and features that have not been previously
              described.",

              immunity against pathogens. However, it remains unclear how
              differences in the TCR contribute to heterogeneity in T cell
              state. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow
              simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global
              transcriptional profile from single cells. However, current
              methods for TCR inference from scRNA-seq are limited in their
              sensitivity and require long sequencing reads, thus increasing
              the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly
              analyzed. Here we present TRAPeS, a publicly available tool that
              can efficiently extract TCR sequence information from short-read
              scRNA-seq libraries. We apply it to investigate heterogeneity in
              the CD8+ T cell response in humans and mice, and show that it is
              accurate and more sensitive than existing approaches. Coupling
              TRAPeS with transcriptome analysis of CD8+ T cells specific for a
              single epitope from Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), we show that the
              recently described `naive-like' memory population have
              significantly longer CDR3 regions and greater divergence from
              germline sequence than do effector-memory phenotype cells. This
              suggests that TCR usage is associated with the differentiation
              state of the CD8+ T cell response to YFV.",

  author   = "McCarthy, Davis J and Chen, Yunshun and Smyth, Gordon K",
  abstract = "A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of
              read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the
              ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple
              treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking
              full account of biological variation. Biological variation
              between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical
              variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel
              empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific
              variability, even when there are relatively few biological
              replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline
              is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project.
              A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability
              of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential
              expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific
              expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow
              for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common
              dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance
              and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with
              inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on
              changes that are consistent between biological replicates.
              Parallel computational approaches are developed to make
              non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the
              application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and
              practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
              profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of
              biological variability in complex situations. When variation is
              gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous
              compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or
              separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also
              be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications,
              including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation

              increasingly used to study gene expression at the level of
              individual cells. However, preparing raw sequence data for
              further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases,

              the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on
              pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization. RESULTS:
              We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate
              rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalization and
              visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a
              convenient, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads
              into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream
              analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for
              single-cell data and a flexible data structure that is compatible
              with existing tools and can be used as infrastructure for future
              software development. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The

  abstract = "Single cell RNA-seq experiments provide valuable insight into
              cellular heterogeneity but suffer from low coverage, 3' bias and
              technical noise. These unique properties of single cell RNA-seq
              data make study of alternative splicing difficult, and thus most
              single cell studies have restricted analysis of transcriptome
              variation to the gene level. To address these limitations, we
              developed SingleSplice, which uses a statistical model to detect
              genes whose isoform usage shows biological variation
              significantly exceeding technical noise in a population of single
              cells. Importantly, SingleSplice is tailored to the unique

              full-length transcripts. Using data from spike-in transcripts, we

              Paradoxically, although both are of intermediate mesoderm in

              (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the
              near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the
              fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression
              studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that
              counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different
              across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software
              package for examining differential expression of replicated count
              data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both
              biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are
              used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts,
              improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be
              used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
              at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.
              The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,
              such as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is

              into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate
              gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by
              marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that
              control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct
              lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely
              known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers
              and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional
              transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations. Here we
              show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these
              problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types
              and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic
              single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at
              four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to
              measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental
              and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We
              empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an
              unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori
              knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous
              purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic
              outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity
              in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously
              unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators
              that discriminate between the different populations. We
              reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of
              bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and
              elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell
              lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any
              developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly

              standard method for gene expression measurement, providing unique
              insights into cellular processes. A number of methods, based on
              general dimensionality reduction techniques, have been suggested

              populations from single-cell expression levels, yet their models

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The advent of high throughput RNA-seq at the
              single-cell level has opened up new opportunities to elucidate
              the heterogeneity of gene expression. One of the most widespread
              applications of RNA-seq is to identify genes which are
              differentially expressed between two experimental conditions.
              RESULTS: We present a discrete, distributional method for
              differential gene expression (D(3)E), a novel algorithm
              specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. We use
              synthetic data to evaluate D(3)E, demonstrating that it can
              detect changes in expression, even when the mean level remains
              unchanged. Since D(3)E is based on an analytically tractable
              stochastic model, it provides additional biological insights by
              quantifying biologically meaningful properties, such as the
              average burst size and frequency. We use D(3)E to investigate
              experimental data, and with the help of the underlying model, we
              directly test hypotheses about the driving mechanism behind
              changes in gene expression. CONCLUSION: Evaluation using
              synthetic data shows that D(3)E performs better than other
              methods for identifying differentially expressed genes since it
              is designed to take full advantage of the information available
              from single-cell RNA-seq experiments. Moreover, the analytical
              model underlying D(3)E makes it possible to gain additional
              biological insights.",

              Mpath, an algorithm that derives multi-branching developmental
              trajectories using neighborhood-based cell state transitions.
              Applied to mouse conventional dendritic cell (cDC) progenitors,

              macrophage/DC progenitors through common DC progenitor to

              detect a branching event at the preDC stage revealing preDC

              transition of their transcriptomes is a useful way to study gene
              expression dynamics in a heterogeneous cell population.
              Currently, a limited number of computational tools are available
              for this task, and quantitative methods for comparing different
              tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell Analysis (TSCAN) is a
              software tool developed to better support in silico pseudo-Time
              reconstruction in Single-Cell RNA-seq ANalysis. TSCAN uses a
              cluster-based minimum spanning tree (MST) approach to order
              cells. Cells are first grouped into clusters and an MST is then
              constructed to connect cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained
              by projecting each cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence
              of cells can be used to study dynamic changes of gene expression
              along the pseudo-time. Clustering cells before MST construction
              reduces the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to
              improved cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently
              adjust the ordering based on prior knowledge. TSCAN has a
              graphical user interface (GUI) to support data visualization and

              technologies have become powerful tools to study RNA and DNA
              methylation profiles of single cells at a genome-wide scale. A
              major challenge has been to understand the direct correlation of
              DNA methylation and gene expression within single-cells. Due to
              large cell-to-cell variability and the lack of direct
              measurements of transcriptome and methylome of the same cell, the
              association is still unclear. RESULTS: Here, we describe a novel
              method (scMT-seq) that simultaneously profiles both DNA methylome
              and transcriptome from the same cell. In sensory neurons, we
              consistently identify transcriptome and methylome heterogeneity
              among single cells but the majority of the expression variance is
              not explained by proximal promoter methylation, with the
              exception of genes that do not contain CpG islands. By contrast,
              gene body methylation is positively associated with gene
              expression for only those genes that contain a CpG island
              promoter. Furthermore, using single nucleotide polymorphism
              patterns from our hybrid mouse model, we also find positive
              correlation of allelic gene body methylation with allelic
              expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our method can be used to detect
              transcriptome, methylome, and single nucleotide polymorphism

              heterogeneity in gene expression levels in seemingly homogeneous
              populations of cells. However, these experiments are prone to
              high levels of unexplained technical noise, creating new
              challenges for identifying genes that show genuine heterogeneous
              expression within the population of cells under study. BASiCS
              (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data) is an
              integrated Bayesian hierarchical model where: (i) cell-specific
              normalisation constants are estimated as part of the model
              parameters, (ii) technical variability is quantified based on
              spike-in genes that are artificially introduced to each analysed
              cell's lysate and (iii) the total variability of the expression
              counts is decomposed into technical and biological components.
              BASiCS also provides an intuitive detection criterion for highly
              (or lowly) variable genes within the population of cells under

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is
              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
              lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
              that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching
              procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in
              mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2
              $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core
              server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity
              and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of
              canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and
              chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
              full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse
              transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
              experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions
              with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of
              the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR

               essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels.
               Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account
               for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation
               and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate
               the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC)
               spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them
               directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not
               reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or
               regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a
               normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV),
               that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor
               analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC
               spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach
               leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and
               tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art
               normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be
