## Overlaying clustering trees

In the clustering trees publication we focused on the use of the visualisation
as a tool for selecting a clustering resolution but more generally it can be
used to display information across the resolution dimension. The visualisation
that is most commonly used to display scRNA-seq data is the dimensionality
reduction plot produced using method such as PCA, t-SNE [@Maaten2008-ne] or
UMAP [@McInnes2018-ul]. In this visualisation each point is a cell placed in a
two-dimensional space and coloured using factors such as the assigned cluster
or the expression level of a gene. If you compare the two visualisations the
dimensionality reduction plot shows information about each individual sample in
a low-dimensional space while the clustering tree trades that cell level
resolution for a summarised view of each cluster and swaps the spatial
information a new resolution dimension. It is possible to combine these two
approaches by overlaying a clustering tree on to a dimensionality reduction
plot. Figure \@ref(fig:clustree-overlay) shows an example of this using the
iris dataset [@Anderson1935-mt; Fisher1936-wt].

(ref:scap-clustree-overlay) Clustering tree of the iris dataset overlaid on a PCA plot.

(ref:cap-clustree-overlay) Clustering tree of the iris dataset overlaid on a PCA plot. (A) A PCA plot of the samples in the iris dataset coloured by cluster at $k = 5$ overlaid with a clustering tree showing clustering resolutions from $k = 1$ to $k = 5$. (B) The same plot show from the direction of the x-axis (PC1), the y-axis now shows the clustering resolution and samples are jittered along the x-axis. (C) Same as (B) but from the direction of PC2.

Here instead of using a tree layout algorithm to decide where the cluster nodes
are placed we place them in the low-dimensional space at the mean position of
the samples in each cluster. The easiest way to view this overlaid plot (Figure
\@ref(fig:clustree-overlay)A) is to imagine looking down on a landscape from
above. On the ground we have the individual sample points (here coloured by
their highest resolution cluster) and rising up from that we have the
clustering tree with the highest resolutions placed closest to the ground and
the lowest resolution at the top. As we step down the clustering tree we can
see where in this space new clusters are formed. Figures
\@ref(fig:clustree-overlay) B and C show this same view but from a different
perspective. Here imaging standing on the ground at the same level as the
samples and looking towards the clustering tree. Now the x-axis shows one of
the reduced dimensions (PC1 or PC2) and the y-axis show the resolution
dimension. Looking at a clustering tree in this way provides an alternative
view where the focus is less on the structure of the tree itself and more on
how it fits into a space that researchers are more familiar with.
