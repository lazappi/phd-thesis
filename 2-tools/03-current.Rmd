(ref:scap-tools) State of the scRNA-tools database.

(ref:cap-tools) State of the scRNA-tools database. (A) Size of the database
over time. (B) Publication status of tools in the database, most tools are
published as either peer-reviewed publications or preprints. (C) Associated
software licenses, most tools are covered by open-source licenses but around
a quarter of tools still have no license. (D) Software platforms used by tools,
R is the most common programming language followed by Python. (E) Number of
tools that complete each analysis task. Tasks associated with multiple analysis
phases are the most common along with those that assign cells.
