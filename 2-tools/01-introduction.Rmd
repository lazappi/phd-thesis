## Introduction

When I began my PhD in early 2016 single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies were
just beginning to become widely available. Since then there has been a rapid
uptake and there are now many studies using this approach. Along with the
growth in the adoption of scRNA-seq technologies there has been an explosion in
the number of software tools for analysing these datasets. This chapter charts
the growth in the scRNA-seq analysis landscape over time.

In 2016 there were relatively few analysis methods available and to answer
questions like how many tools perform a particular task or which areas were
developers focusing on or was there a tool for doing this I began to record
details about them. Inspired by similar projects such as Sean Davis' Awesome
Single Cell page I decided to make this collection public. This turned out to be
useful to other researchers and over time a simple spreadsheet became the
scRNA-tools database and website (https://scRNA-tools.org). A paper published
in _PLoS Computational Biology_ describing this resource forms the main part of
this chapter.

By having access to details about existing analysis tools we were able to
explore how the field has developed. We found that computational researchers
had focused their efforts on analysis tasks specific to scRNA-seq data such as
clustering and ordering of cells or handling the larger numbers of zeros. We
also saw that many of the tools performed tasks common to several stages of
analysis including dimensionality reduction of various kinds and visualisation.
Developers of scRNA-seq analysis tools tend to embrace a open-source and
open-science approach. Most tools are developed on GitHub were others can ask
questions and submit improvements. The majority are also available under
open-source licenses allowing their code to be reused for other purposes,
although there is also a significant proportion that do not have any associated
license. Tools are commonly made public by releasing a preprint publication,
making them available to the community much more quickly and giving early
adopters a chance to contribute to their development.

A section at the end of this chapter presents an updated version of some of this
analysis based on the most recent version of the database.
