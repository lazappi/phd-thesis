<p>My thesis explores the computational tools and techniques used to analyse
single-cell RNA sequencing data. This type of data is the result of new
technologies that have been developed over the last few years. It is now
possible to capture individual cells, extract and isolate RNA from them and
quantify the expression levels of genes in each cell. These new technologies
allow us to inspect cells in a new way and open up a range of possibilities for
biological studies, but usefulness of these technologies relies on our ability
to interpret the data they produce. My PhD has coincided with a surge in the
development of methods that attempt to make sense of this data and my thesis
aims to chart this development and contribute to it. My contributions revolve
around how we make decisions during an scRNA-seq analysis, which tools do we
choose, how do we know that they work and what parameter values should we use?</p>
<p>My thesis contains four discrete but related projects that explore scRNA-seq
analysis methods and decisions made during the analysis process.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter <a href="2-tools.html#tools">2</a> - <a href="2-tools.html#tools">The scRNA-seq tools landscape</a></strong> I present my work
developing and maintaining the scRNA-tools database, a database of software
tools for analysing scRNA-seq data. I have recorded the details of over
450 tools including where they have been published, where the code
is available, associated software licenses and the types of analysis they can
perform. The scRNA-tools database allows researchers to identify focus areas of
methods development, captures features of how tools are developed and shared,
and displays trends in tool development over time. I have also designed a
website interface to the database that makes this resource easily available to
the research community. This website has been visited by hundreds of
researchers from around the world. Over time new kinds of analysis have emerged
and these could be integrated into the scRNA-tools database as categories to
better organise the tools that are present. In the future the performance of
the website could also be improved, particularly to better handle the large
number of tools that it now displays.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter <a href="3-simulation.html#simulation">3</a> - <a href="3-simulation.html#simulation">Simulating scRNA-seq data</a></strong> describes Splatter,
a software package for generating synthetic scRNA-seq datasets. Developers of
new analysis tools should demonstrate their tools’ effectiveness and
simulations are an important way of evaluating computational methods. Splatter
provides a consistent, easy-to-use interface to several published simulations
models, allowing researchers to select the most appropriate model for their
situation. This interface includes functions for estimating parameters from
real datasets, objects for storing those parameters and functions for using
them to produce synthetic datasets with associated intermediate values, in a
standard format. One of these models is the Splat simulation we introduced in
the Splatter publication. This model is based on a negative binomial
distribution and includes many of the features considered important in
scRNA-seq, data including variation in total counts per cell, relationships
between the mean and variance of each gene, and the ability to add additional
dropout based on mean expression. The Splat model has been designed to be
flexible and can be used to generate datasets with different properties,
including different groups of cells, batch effects and continuous trajectories.
Splatter also contains functions for assessing the similarity of simulations to
real scRNA-seq datasets and we used these to compare the performance of several
simulation models. The results showed good performance for the Splat model
overall, however we did see that performance varied with different capture
technologies and tissue types. When comparing the models currently available in
Splatter I saw that those with sophisticated estimation procedures, including
BASiCS and ZINB-WaVE, performed extremely well. The performance of these newer
models suggests that the Splat estimation procedure could be improved and doing
so would improve its usefulness for developers. The simulation model could also
be extended in various ways, for example by including an underlying gene
network or by making it possible to use the same set of intermediate values for
multiple simulations.</p>
<p>One of the analysis steps that has received a large amount of attention from
scRNA-seq methods developers is using unsupervised clustering to form groups of
cells with similar transcriptional protocols. These approaches could be
assessed using simulations and each method will have some parameters that
affect how many clusters are produced. The number of clusters used in an
analysis can affect how the results are interpreted but choosing these
parameters is difficult. In <strong>Chapter <a href="4-clust-trees.html#clust-trees">4</a> - <a href="4-clust-trees.html#clust-trees">Visualising
clustering across resolutions</a></strong> I introduce clustering trees, an alternative,
visualisation-based approach for selecting parameters that affect cluster
number. For this approach a dataset is clustered multiple times at different
resolutions and the overlap of samples between clusters at neighbouring
resolutions is used to create a graph structure that is displayed as a tree.
The structure of this tree can provide clues as to which resolution is most
appropriate for an analysis, and more generally this visualisation can be used
to display information across resolutions. How useful the clustering tree
visualisation is depends somewhat on the clustering method used and it can
become cluttered when there are many clusters present. Further work could look
at improving these aspects of the algorithm and adapting it for fuzzy
clustering methods. I also believe that the general idea of forming a graph of
clusters may have other uses in a variety of applications. The clustering trees
algorithm is implemented in a software package that is publicly available from
the CRAN repository.</p>
<p>The final project of my PhD was to analyse a kidney organoid scRNA-seq dataset.
This dataset was introduced in a publication investigating variability in the
organoid differentiation protocol, where it was used to confirm that much of
the variability is due to differences between batches rather than between
organoids from the same batch. In a second publication, for which I performed
the computational analysis, this dataset was profiled more thoroughly and the
cell types present were identified. These included many of the cell types
expected in the developing kidney as well as some off-target populations. To
confirm these cell types we integrated the organoid data with a human foetal
kidney dataset and found that many of the cell types were consistent. In
<strong>Chapter <a href="5-analysis.html#analysis">5</a> - <a href="5-analysis.html#analysis">Analysis of kidney organoid scRNA-seq data</a></strong> I
re-analysed this dataset to demonstrate some alternative tools that we could
have used in the analysis, focusing on how the decisions made at different
stages affect the results. My main finding here was that using alternative
droplet selection methods resulted in many more cells being included in the
analysis. Continuing the analysis with these additional cells showed and that
many of them were from a population which showed some evidence of an
immune-like signature. While immune cells are not expected in kidney organoids,
and their presence would need to be validated experimentally, there is a
plausible pathway by which they could emerge and we did see hints of their
presence in the published analysis. My re-analysis also showed robustness of
the clustering methods used to how genes were selected and the presence of the
additional cells. For both the published analysis and the analysis in this
thesis chapter I have followed a reproducible analysis workflow, including
producing websites to display the analysis code and results and making the
version controlled code publicly available.</p>
<p>The rise of single-cell technologies has been staggering and over the course of
my PhD the field has moved from exploratory studies with a few hundred cells to
detailed investigations of complex tissues and processes with tens or hundreds
of thousands of cells. Although scRNA-seq technologies have only been available
for a short time, they continue to improve and over the next few years we will
continue to see significant changes. New platforms and protocols will be
developed and used to generate even larger and more detailed datasets.
Experiments that combine scRNA-seq with other single-cell measurements such as
chromatin accessibility will become more common, as will spatial
transcriptomics technologies that can retain a cell’s position in a tissue
while measuring its transcriptional profile.</p>
<p>The continued improvement in single-cell technologies will require further
development of computational methods for analysing the data they produce,
building on the significant work that has already been done. As bigger datasets
become more common, tools will need to be carefully engineered to handle the
computational workload. Bigger studies will also require methods to integrate
multiple samples and different types of data. This has already become a
significant area of research but it is a difficult problem and I expect it will
take some time for the robustness and effectiveness of these methods to be
established.</p>
<p>As I have discussed throughout my thesis, deciding which methods to use for
various tasks is a crucial part of scRNA-seq analysis. Currently these
decisions are largely made based on the analyst’s experience and intuition,
what is common practice and how easy tools are to install and use. Benchmarking
and comparison studies are vital for helping to understand which tools are
effective, but they can be difficult and time consuming to perform. For some
analysis tasks, such as differential expression testing, there are established
evaluation metrics that can be used, but for others, such as ordering of cells
or integration of datasets, it is less clear how to measure performance.
Developing new metrics is vital for informative comparisons. As more
benchmarking studies are performed, I hope the field crystallises around an
established set of methods for common tasks and energy can be redirected
towards alternative approaches, performing complex and novel analyses and
improving the quality, usability and efficiency of existing tools.</p>
<p>Even when scRNA-seq analysis methods are reliable and effective, interpreting
their results can be difficult and requires the input of a domain expert. Often
there is a somewhat circular process where established knowledge is used to
evaluate results from what is supposed to be an unsupervised process. To some
degree this is the result of the novelty of the field and a reluctance to trust
unfamiliar methods, but it is also true that we are looking at biology at a new
resolution and this is challenging our current understanding. Large scale
profiling projects such as the Human Cell Atlas will make interpretation easier
by providing a reference to test against. When it is easier to assign
identities to cells, it will become more practical to perform designed
experiments such as studies that investigate the effect of a drug in a target
cell type in a particular tissue. This has already begun to happen as
exploratory analyses have been completed on many tissues. However, building
these reference atlases is an extremely difficult task that will take many
years and a well-coordinated global effort. Developing methods that best make
use of these references will also require significant research but that is an
effort that is already underway.</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing is an exciting technology that has opened up a world
of possibilities, but we are still at the early stages of working out how best
to use it. My contribution to this effort is in building a database that tracks
the analysis tools that are available, and developing simulation software that
can be used to evaluate methods. As well as deciding which tool to use,
analysts need to choose parameters for those they select and I have developed a
visualisation that can help choose parameters that change clustering
resolution. I have also contributed to the biological literature by performing
the computational analysis in a study that profiled the cell types present in
kidney organoids and exploring how the decisions made during this analysis
could affect the results and how they are interpreted. Overall I believe I have
made a significant contribution to the emerging field of single-cell RNA
sequencing data analysis during my PhD.</p>
