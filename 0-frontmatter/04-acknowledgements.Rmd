Thank you to my supervisors Alicia Oshlack and Melissa Little, it has been a
pleasure and a privilege to work with you over the last few years. You both
provide supportive environments that let people get the most out of themselves
and I am fortunate to have had you to guide me through my PhD.

That support extends to the other members of the Oshlack lab. It's easy to come
into work every day when you get on with your colleagues and enjoy spending
time with them. A special thanks to Belinda Phipson who as being an amazing
source of advice about statistics and analysis but also just life in general.
The Little kidney development lab has also been extremely welcoming. Thank you
to all of them for making me feel a part of their group and sharing their
knowledge, particularly Alex Combes who it has been fantastic to work closely
with.

Outside my work a big part of my PhD has been involvement with COMBINE. Thank
you to everyone who has contributed to building and continuing to develop the
organisation, particularly Leah Roberts who has guided me through everything.
The Australian bioinformatics student community is extremely fortunate to have
such as an organisation and I hope students and supervisors continue to support
COMBINE and make it even better.

Thank you to my friends and family for the support you have provided outside my
PhD, it's important to have other things going on in the rest of my life. The
biggest thanks to my partner Sarah for her continued love and care (and
proofreading expertise).

Lastly I want to thank the wider scientific and programming communities.
Everyone who makes their code, software, data and analysis available makes this
kind of research possible, easier and more fun.
